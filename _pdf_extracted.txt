Foreword
The healthcare systems of most industrialised nations have a
problem that needs the attention of pharmacists, if it is to be solved
correctly. The problem is the poor quality of medicines use, and
the solution includes increased pharmacist participation in medi-
cines management.
Studies from many nations, conducted over many years, have
shown the need for better management of drug therapy. This ﬁrst
became clear from ‘process’ studies showing some inappropriate
prescribing, inadequate monitoring and advice, and patient non-
adherence. Other studies took this a step further, and conﬁrmed
not only the prevalence of adverse outcomes of drug therapy, but
also that such adverse outcomes often could have been prevented
by more careful management. For example, the median preventa-
bility rate in one review was 59%.
1
Mis-managed drug therapy may rank as one of the leading
causes of hospital admission, because of adverse reactions, under-
treatment, or non-treatment. The median rate of hospital
admissions from preventable drug-related morbidity (PDRM)* in
that review was 4.3%. This would rank PDRM with cancer,
coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus and asthma as a leading
cause of hospital admissions in many countries. The rate of adverse
outcomes among inpatients typically was 1.5%, and adverse drug
events may prolong hospital stays by 2–4 days.
1,2
* PDRM is much broader than adverse drug reactions (ADR) and somewhat
broader than adverse drug events (ADE). Like ADE, PDRM includes errors and
other problems in drug use as well as injury caused by the ineffective use or
non-use of indicated drugs.


===== PAGE 11 =====
The possibilities of safer and more effective drug therapy have
been clear, and evidence has been mounting about how to improve
them. When pharmacists systematically cooperate with patients
and other healthcare providers, with the objective of improving the
outcomes of drug therapy, outcomes often improve and costs often
decrease.
3,4
The road to medicines management has not been like a broad,
smooth motorway. Parts of it are, so to speak, unpaved and even
unmarked. After nearly two decades of effort by practice
researchers, practitioners and pharmaceutical societies throughout
Europe and North America, some national programmes, for
example, in the USA and the UK, have in effect recognised the need
for pharmacists to participate fully in cooperative patient-centred
systems. Success on the road ahead will require commitment,
planning and effort.
How should pharmacists direct their efforts? Despite the
conventional wisdom, prescribing problems are not the leading
cause of preventable, drug-related hospital admissions. About 70%
of such admissions involved some aspect of the management of
ongoing drug therapy. Management of therapy included follow-up
monitoring and detection of therapeutic problems, for example,
treatment failures, laboratory tests not being done or not being
acted upon, and moderate adverse drug reactions that were
allowed to become so severe that they necessitated admission.
Problems with prescribing, including drug choice, dosage and route
accounted for about 16%; drug distribution and administration,
including patient non-adherence, accounted for about 13%.
Among inpatients, the situation was roughly the opposite: most
problems involved prescribing and the fewest involved follow up.
2
As prescribing is not a leading cause of PDRM in ambulatory
care, simple prescribing improvement programmes such as formu-
laries are ineffective when the goal is to improve patient outcomes
or reduce total costs or care. Likewise, compliance improvement
programmes may improve medication-taking behaviour but rarely
show a positive effect on outcomes. The outcomes of drug therapy
in ambulatory care can be improved by increasing organised
x Foreword


===== PAGE 12 =====
(systematic) cooperation among pharmacists, physicians and
patients. Such changes are associated with improved outcomes and
reduced total costs of care in many studies.
3,4 Even modest
improvements in customary arrangements may be associated with
improved outcomes, lower total costs of care, or both.
Pharmacists are strategically important, but they are not
essential. If pharmacy is not up to the task, others will surely step
forward. Our public image is favourable, but has been somewhat
dated. Patients and policymakers in some countries have now
begun to change their impression of pharmacists, from a dispenser
to a drug expert who can help patients make the best use of their
medicines.
Pharmaceutical education, and in some cases, re-education in
pharmacotherapeutics will be one essential ingredient in
pharmacy’s efforts. Some pharmacists, however, do not intervene,
even when they see and understand a drug therapy problem, its
causes and its solutions. I have long suspected that one underlying
cause of such inaction is a lack of conﬁdence, as if pharmacists do
not appreciate their own knowledge and how much they can
contribute to patient welfare. If this book helps pharmacists to
focus, recognise and appreciate their clinical knowledge, it will be
a useful addition to that enterprise.
The road to pharmaceutical care and medicines management
may be uncharted, but it does not go through a mineﬁeld where
we can lose everything from one error. We are not in a game that
we can lose if our failures outnumber our successes. We are like
the pilot in the ﬁrst chapter of Tom Wolfe’s The Right Stuff . We
need to keep trying until we ﬁnd what succeeds, and then take the
next step. We are succeeding.

Preface
This book edited by Lilian Azzopardi is aimed at helping pharmacy
students and pharmacists to grasp the principles of clinical
pharmacy during their career development. The book presents 320
multiple-choice questions, and for each question a concise answer
is given. It is highly practical, short and to the point. As a seasoned
examiner, I would recommend it as a useful revision aid.
Another characteristic of the book is that it shifts the focus
from theory to clinical applications, reﬂecting the growing trend to
change critical appraisals into clinical action. The examples feature
real case histories, providing the opportunity to simulate actual
practice, where multiple problems are presented, decisions need to
be taken, and the required monitoring of the patient may be inﬂu-
enced by the occurrence of concurrent disease states.
This context, where multiple problem scenarios are
presented, stimulates the candidate to think and generate ideas
similar to those required in practice, where an holistic approach is
required for optimum management. The questions addressing the
cases are developed so as to stress the general principles and
concepts that can be applied to other situations, as well as to
discuss issues that are particular to the patient.
The uniqueness of this publication lies in the fact that the
authors were able to produce a book which presents problems that
are taken from contemporary clinical practice. It induces candi-
dates to acquire those skills that are needed to tackle clinical
pharmacy practice issues effectively.
I am conﬁdent that the book reﬂects the enthusiasm Lilian
and her colleagues have for the practice of clinical pharmacy and


===== PAGE 15 =====
for developing problem-based learning approaches in teaching and
career development. Clinical pharmacy is the basis for pharma-
ceutical care. Therefore it is very relevant that the book extends its
parameters to include practical issues related to the development
of pharmaceutical care plans, drug therapy selection and drug
therapy monitoring. Again, as it draws strongly on the practical
aspect, the book should also be used by pharmacists for continu-
ing professional development in the area of clinical pharmacy,
including those serving society in all aspects of pharmaceutical
care.

In the development of the concept of this publication, I have drawn
on my experience in teaching and practicing clinical pharmacy.
Looking back, I can state that I have been able to develop these
skills by working in collaboration with a number of colleagues,
mostly from the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery at the University
of Malta. Most importantly I am indebted to Professor Anthony
Serracino-Inglott and to Dr Maurice Zarb-Adami from the Depart-
ment of Pharmacy, who have inspired me through their dedication
for pharmacy to develop clinical pharmacy skills that put the
patient in focus and to perform effective teaching of students. They
had vision about my enthusiasm for providing useful student
revision aids.
Together with Professor Steve Hudson, University of Strath-
clyde and Professor Sam Salek, University of Cardiff, I have
discussed at length clinical pharmacy practice in different
scenarios. This book reﬂects the philosophies of my colleagues
Anthony Serracino-Inglott, Maurice Zarb-Adami, Steve Hudson
and Sam Salek. Indeed it was again a pleasure for all of us to work
together for a third publication.
I am especially indebted to Professor Roger Ellul-Micallef,
Head of the Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Thera-
peutics at the University of Malta for his very relevant comments
on the material presented in the book. Special thanks go to Dr
Bernard Coleiro, Senior Registrar, Department of Medicine at St
Luke’s Hospital, to my sister Louise Azzopardi, clinical pharma-
cist at St Luke’s Hospital and to Dr Mark Grech, Medical Ofﬁcer,

Introduction
In the years following the Second World War, the contribution that
pharmacists could make to the successful treatment of patients, by
being involved in the selection of that treatment, began to be appre-
ciated.
The subject of clinical pharmacy was developed in the late
1960s to help pharmacists meet the challenge of acquiring an
education that places the patient at the centre of their professional
activity. This book should help to enhance the clinical aspects of
pharmacy education.
In today’s climate of burgeoning information and complex
clinical issues, a career in clinical pharmacy is more demanding
than ever. Increasingly, training in clinical aspects of pharmacy
must prepare pharmacists to seek and synthesise the necessary
information and to apply that information successfully. The ques-
tions in this book are designed not only to provide examples that
may be asked in clinical pharmacy examinations, but also to
provide a logical framework for organising, learning, reviewing
and applying the conceptual and factual information to the clinical
scenario.
The clinical pharmacist must be able to select the relevant
information and apply it effectively to the clinical situation. The
experienced clinical pharmacist has acquired some clinical perspec-
tive through practice: we hope that this book (especially the case
studies) imparts some of this to the relatively inexperienced. The
format and contents are designed for the examination candidate but
the same approach to problems should help the practising clinical
pharmacist in the lifelong education required in everyday work.


===== PAGE 23 =====
The book is not meant to be used as an introduction to
clinical pharmacy for the undergraduate, because the questions
assume much basic knowledge, and considerable detailed infor-
mation had to be omitted from the answers. Although the book
has a number of appendices giving deﬁnitions of conditions and
terminology, abbreviations and acronyms, and clinical laboratory
data, these are intended to serve as an aide-memoire; they are not
meant to replace the need for continually consulting references in
the ﬁeld.
The questions presented in the four tests are divided into two
parts: essential background information, which is covered in
approximately the ﬁrst 25% of the questions in each test; and the
clinical approach, as seen in the case studies. In the case studies we
have considered the situation that a candidate meets in a clinical
scenario. Although the cases are all speciﬁc, by ﬁnishing the four
tests the candidate should have learnt that the best way to carry
out these exercises is to follow a systematic approach.
Most of the cases dealt with in these tests involve circum-
stances met with in daily practice, such as pulmonary oedema,
heart failure, hypothyroidism, dehydration and diabetes. A large
number of common diseases are included but certainly not all. We
highly recommend reading the short explanations of the answers,
even when a correct answer is achieved, as we emphasise points
that are understressed in some textbooks.
We have also included a couple of cases that are relatively not
so common in everyday practice. It is necessary for the clinical
pharmacist to know about these and to be capable of reaching a
solution to the presented problem. It is to be remembered that in
some scenarios clinical pharmacist services are available on an as-
and-when-required basis. In such a case, the clinical pharmacist is
often consulted when a rare case is met with, especially by junior
doctors. An example from this book is the case describing an
overdose of promethazine and alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
Supplementary reading is essential to understand the basic
pathology involved in these cases, but the information given in the
short answers is probably all that needs to be known by the
xxii Introduction


===== PAGE 24 =====
candidate, and should be sufﬁcient to provide the knowledge
required to reach the correct answer. It should be noted that an
awareness of some rare situations is essential, because it is often in
such cases that the availability of a clinical pharmacist could lead
to the correct treatment; it may be instrumental in improving the
prognosis and on occasions may even be life saving.
Questions on such conditions are also important for candi-
dates preparing for examinations, because examiners tend to
include a rare case or two, to avoid setting a stereotyped examina-
tion involving the same diseases.
We have not attempted to cover all aspects of clinical
pharmacy but – by cross-referencing between one case and another,
and by using the questions that do not involve case studies – only
a few subjects were omitted. This is reinforced by a cursory look
at the indices, on generic names, subject and conditions, in addition
to the cases index. Highly specialized situations, such as those
occurring in oncology, were thought to be unsuitable for inclusion
here. Psychiatry and dermatology are two areas that are often
forgotten by clinical pharmacy students during revision; both
subjects are very relevant to pharmacy.
Clinical pharmacists need to understand basic facts on
diseases and the relevance of laboratory tests (including common
abbreviations and acronyms), to be able to contribute their expert-
ise on therapeutic management in the clinical scenario. The ﬁrst
questions in each test cover these requirements, which are needed
to tackle the comprehensive case study questions.
Before tackling the case studies questions, it is worth ensuring
that you can answer correctly the questions in the beginning of the
test. Knowledge of the meaning of medical terms such as hypoxia,
tachypnoea, myopathy and dysphasia, the signiﬁcance of labora-
tory tests such as INR, HbA1c, BUN, TSH, LFT and MCV and of
the meaning of abbreviations such as PMH, O/E, PC and FH is
also tested in the questions. It may be wise to read through
appendices A, B and C, which give the meaning of medical terms,
abbreviations and the significance of laboratory tests, before
attempting the questions.
Introduction xxiii


===== PAGE 25 =====
Other short questions require a knowledge of side-effects of
medicines, disease symptoms and reasons for the occurrence of
certain reactions, such as resistance to drug therapy. The speciﬁc
advice that needs to be given to patients in relation to the use of
particular medicines, such as when dispensing isosorbide dinitrate,
is emphasised throughout the text. Clinical pharmacists ought to
have a thorough, detailed knowledge of drugs, including indica-
tions, contraindications, monitoring requirements, dosage
regimens, adverse effects and when reporting is required, and of
different classiﬁcations, such as chemical or therapeutic. A list of
all drugs mentioned in the text is conveniently presented in the
generic name index. You can use this index as a self-test to conﬁrm
your preparedness by answering these questions: (1) when is this
drug indicated?; (2) what are the contraindications or cautions?;
(3) what adverse effects may occur and which of these require early
or immediate attention?; (4) how is the drug classiﬁed and what is
its mechanism of action?; (5) does the drug have particular
properties that are of great relevance, such as tolerance, addiction,
teratogenicity and the possibility of resistance developing?
In this book our aim is to base questions on those aspects of
clinical pharmacy that bear most relevance to practice and which
enjoy wide general acceptance. It is hoped that the questions will
be useful not only to candidates preparing for examinations, both
undergraduate and postgraduate, but also to practitioners as a
means of continuing education. We have tried to avoid excessive
detail in the way of ﬁgures, laboratory investigations and in the
facts given; in general those that are included are of value and
essential to tackle the question.
The purpose of this book is to revise aspects of clinical
pharmacy, to prepare for examinations and to apply pharmacy
concepts in continued self-education at undergraduate and post-
graduate level. It has been our experience that students who under-
stand the basic pharmaceutical sciences such as physiology,
biochemistry, medicinal chemistry, pharmaceutics and pharmacol-
ogy have little difficulty in practising as clinical pharmacists,
whereas those who have learned their basic subjects in a parrot-
xxiv Introduction


===== PAGE 26 =====
like fashion are unlikely to thrive in clinical pharmacy, as making
good use of the basic sciences is a requirement. This book there-
fore also serves to show how essential the basic sciences are to
perform well in clinical pharmacy.
An advantage of having an MCQs book as a revision tool is
that during a revision exercise you must commit yourself to an
opinion – using MCQs you have the opportunity to conﬁrm that
the opinion is correct. When mistaken, with the aid of the Answers
section, you can pursue the matter until you understand why your
answer was incorrect. The Answers section should also serve to
reinforce the correct impressions. We do not profess that clinical
pharmacy could be reduced to a mere collection of question and
answer statements, which are all 100% true or false. However we
hope that you will ﬁnd, on investigation and reﬂection, that most
of the statements correlate to real-case scenarios, where a decision
often must be taken in the manner reﬂected in the text.

Revision checklist
For each test, write the number of the question and your answer
on a separate sheet of paper, then after going through all the
questions in the test, compare your answers with those in the book.
Refer to Appendix D for feedback on those questions that
you did not answer correctly, to be able to compare your ability
with a cohort of students.
Appendix A includes deﬁnitions of medical terms included in
the book, while Appendix B lists abbreviations and acronyms.
Appendix C presents laboratory test results for parameters that are
mentioned in the book.
Checklist
This checklist should help students identify areas that need to be
covered when preparing for an exam in clinical pharmacy.
● Patient assessment: physical assessment skills, laboratory and
diagnostic information
● Therapeutic planning: problem identiﬁcation, pharmaceutical
care plan, selection of therapeutic regimens, patient moni-
toring
● Monitoring drug therapy: patient counselling, adverse effects,
baseline tests
● Drug information: patient counselling, cautionary labels,
cautions, contraindications
● Responding to symptoms: presentation of conditions, diag-
nosis, referrals, use of non-prescription medicines, patient
counselling

Test 1
Answers
Questions 1–3
Interpretation of clinical laboratory tests is useful during diagnosis and during
therapeutic monitoring. Common laboratory tests include electrolytes, haema-
tology, renal function tests and liver function tests. In interpreting clinical
laboratory tests, it is important to use different tests to corroborate information
because laboratory errors are not uncommon, caused by, for example, spoiled
specimens, incorrect amount of specimen and medications that could interfere
with test results. Furthermore, laboratory investigations are best collaborated
through supporting clinical evidence. When possible laboratory results are
best evaluated in an holistic approach.
A1 A
The mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is a red cell index
that forms part of haematology tests. It measures the average concentration
of haemoglobin in erythrocytes (red blood cells). It is decreased in different
presentations of anaemia, including iron deﬁciency anaemia and in thalas-
semia. In iron deﬁciency anaemia, the haematocrit value (space occupied by

The measurement of total and differential white blood cell (WBC) count is a
part of all routine laboratory diagnostic evaluations. It is helpful in the evalu-
ation of a patient with an infection, although a high WBC count may also be
found in other conditions such as neoplasma, allergy and immunosuppression.
One type of WBCs is the lymphocytes, their primary function being to ﬁght
chronic bacterial infection and acute viral infections. Lymphocytes can be

further classiﬁed into B cells and T cells. The mature B cells produce immuno-
globulins. The T cells have cell-mediated immunity as a major property, where
they act directly to eliminate certain microorganisms and regulate the activity
of B cells in producing immunoglobulins. An increased number of lymphocytes
(lymphocytosis) occurs with viral infections, such as in patients with upper
respiratory tract infections, mumps and infectious mononucleosis.

Prednisolone is a corticosteroid with a predominantly glucocorticoid activity.
However, owing to minor mineralcorticoid activity, it may still cause electrolyte
imbalance, namely sodium and water retention and potassium loss. Salbuta-
mol and propranolol do not interfere with plasma sodium electrolyte levels.
Salbutamol may precipitate hypokalaemia, especially with parenteral adminis-
tration or after nebulisation. The risk of hypokalaemia with salbutamol therapy
may be increased with concomitant administration of certain drugs, such as
corticosteroids and diuretics.

Paget’s disease, neuropathy and haemophilia are all conditions that are
associated with the occurrence of muscular or joint pain. Paget’s disease is a
disease of the bone where there is excessive bone destruction and abnormal-

deformity, fractures and pain caused by pressure on nerves. However, Paget’s
disease may be asymptomatic. Neuropathy is a condition where there is
inﬂammation or degeneration of the peripheral nerves. It may occur as a
complication of long-standing uncontrolled diabetes. Patients complain of
excruciating pain in the peripheries. In haemophilia there is a deﬁciency of
one of the factors necessary for blood coagulation. Patients with haemophilia
are prone to develop bleeding in joints, resulting in pain.

Several persistent unexplained symptoms may indicate neoplastic disease and
would require further assessment to understand the underlying pathology.
Symptoms such as skin ulceration, unexplained fractures and general debility
may indicate neoplastic disease. Skin ulceration could occur as a result of skin
carcinoma. Unexplained fractures may be due to carcinoma involving the
bone structure. This tumour usually occurs as a secondary tumour to a solid
tumour that has originated in another area. General debility may be a
characteristic of malignant disorders, such as chronic myelocytic leukaemia,
Hodgkin’s disease, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and various solid tumours.
A10 C
The administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen may fail to achieve
remission in an individual patient compared with a cohort of patients owing
to drug resistance. Tumour cells may be inherently resistant or acquire resist-
ance after a number of treatment sessions. Tumour cell resistance may be
explained by a reduction of intracellular drug concentration, enzymatic
deactivation of the drug, and by increased repair of damaged DNA. If the
drugs fail to penetrate the solid tumour, then they are not in a position to
achieve cell death.

Ultrasound scanning is a non-invasive, non-toxic diagnostic procedure that can
be used to examine internal organs. It does not involve radiation. It is based
on sound waves that travel through the body tissues at different speed
depending on the density and elasticity of the organ tissues. Ultrasound
scanning is used to diagnose conditions such as tumours in areas such as
abdomen, heart, liver and kidneys. It is also used to assess the development
of the fetus.

Creatinine clearance is the rate of removal of creatinine from the body by the
kidney during glomerular ﬁltration. It gives a measure of the glomerular ﬁltra-
tion rate (GFR). The measured creatinine clearance is more accurate in the
assessment of renal function compared with the calculated creatinine
clearance, which is based on a formula where the serum creatinine concen-
tration is used. To measure the creatinine clearance, a 24-h urine collection
and a serum sample are required.

Isosorbide dinitrate is a nitrate that is a more stable preparation compared
with glyceryl trinitrate. Isosorbide dinitrate tablets are stable and do not require
special storage conditions. It is used in the prophylaxis and treatment of
angina and in left ventricular failure. The most common side-effect that may
occur is throbbing headache. Occurrence of this side-effect usually decreases
after a few days. The headache is associated with peripheral vasodilation.
Tolerance to the peripheral effects occurs early on in treatment.

Tamoxifen is an oestrogen-receptor antagonist that is used for breast cancer
and anovulatory infertility. Its side-effects are very similar to the menopausal
phase and hot ﬂushes are a common side-effect. Suppression of menstruation
may occur in premenopausal women. As the use of tamoxifen is associated
with an increased risk of endometrial changes, including hyperplasia, polyps,
cancer and uterine sarcoma, occurrence of menstrual abnormalities, including
abnormal vaginal bleeding and vaginal discharge, warrant immediate investi-
gation. Hence patients receiving tamoxifen should be advised that if menstrual
irregularities occur they should seek medical advice. Tamoxifen can increase
the risk of thromboembolism, and therefore patients should be advised about
the symptoms that may indicate onset of thromboembolism, such as sudden
breathlessness and pain in the calf, so that they seek advice immediately.

Phytomenadione is vitamin K1. Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that is
required for the hepatic synthesis of prothrombin and other blood clotting
factors (factors VII, IX, X and proteins C and S). Neonates are particularly
prone to develop vitamin K deﬁciency and this may lead to haemorrhagic
disease including intracranial bleeding. It may be used in babies at birth as
a single intramuscular injection to prevent vitamin K deﬁciency bleeding.
Vitamin K deﬁciency may occur in underweight neonates owing to inadequate
synthesis.
A20 A
Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin that has a longer duration of
action when compared with unfractionated heparin. The dose for enoxaparin
varies from the dose for heparin; for example, in the prophylaxis of deep vein
thrombosis before surgery, 2000 units of enoxaparin are administered 2 hours
before surgery, whereas for heparin 5000 units are administered 2 hours
before surgery. As with heparin, thrombocytopenia may occur with the
administration of low molecular weight heparins. Enoxaparin should be
avoided in patients who have developed thrombocytopenia with heparin.
Regular monitoring is required when the patient is also taking any drugs that
interfere with haemostasis. The use of oral anticoagulants, dipyridamole,
aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be
reviewed. Care should be taken when used in conjunction with thrombolytic
enzymes and high doses of penicillins and cephalosporins.

Isotretinoin is a retinoid that may be used orally in the specialist management
of severe acne vulgaris. Retinoids have many contraindications and serious
side-effects. Isotretinoin is teratogenic and therefore women of child-bearing
age should be advised to avoid pregnancy and to practise effective contra-
ception. Retinoids should only be used in premenopausal women if they have
severe disabling skin disease that is resistant to other treatment and if
pregnancy has been excluded. Treatment with oral isotretinoin should be
started only during the second or third day of a menstrual cycle and contra-
ceptive precautions should be continued for at least 4 weeks after the end of
treatment. Common side-effects of oral isotretinoin treatment include dryness
of the skin presenting with dermatitis, scaling, thinning, erythema and pruritus,
epidermal fragility and dryness of the lips, pharyngeal mucosa and nasal
mucosa. During treatment and for at least 6 months from stopping treatment,
patients should be advised to avoid wax epilation because of a risk of
epidermal stripping, and to avoid dermabrasion and laser skin treatment as
there is risk of scarring. Patients should be advised to avoid exposure to ultra-

Helicobacter pylori, a Gram-negative bacterium, is implicated as a cause of
chronic gastritis and peptic ulceration. Its eradication in the stomach entails a
triple-therapy regimen that is based on a proton pump inhibitor such as
omeprazole, and two anti-infective agents, namely amoxicillin and either clari-
thromycin or metronidazole. In patients who are penicillin sensitive, the triple
therapy regimen considered consists of a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin
and metronidazole. Telithromycin is a derivative of erythromycin that is not
used in 
Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy.

In patients affected by the human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV), the aim of
treatment is to decrease the plasma viral load as much as possible for the
longest possible time. Before starting treatment or when changing drug
therapy, viral sensitivity to antiretroviral agents should be established. The
onset of drug resistance is reduced by using combination of drugs so as to
have a synergistic or additive effect. Care should be taken to ensure that the
combination used does not have an additive toxicity as antiretrovirals are
toxic. Common combinations include two nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors and either an HIV-protease inhibitor or a non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitor. In HIV, viral replication leading to accumulation of
mutations results in the emergence of drug-resistant variants and consequently
disease progression.

Metolazone is a diuretic that is associated with profound diuresis, especially
when it is combined with a loop diuretic. Patients receiving metolazone should
be monitored for electrolyte imbalance and outcome of therapy may be
assessed by measuring change in body weight and urine production.
A30 A
Metolazone is a diuretic with actions similar to a thiazide diuretic, and
bumetanide is a loop diuretic. Metolazone has a long duration of action of
about 12–24 h compared with intravenous bumetanide, which has a duration
of action of 0.5–1 h. Diuretics increase diuresis and result in a reduction of
blood volume.
A31 B
Once PS is stabilised, a long-term therapeutic plan should be carried out.
Metolazone treatment should be withdrawn, after which a change from
bumetanide to oral therapy should be attempted. The patient should be
advised about the importance of compliance with bumetanide, and that the
unwanted effect of increased diuresis with oral treatment usually decreases
with time. The patient should be advised to take the drug in the morning.
Potassium levels should be monitored and, if the patient is not taking any
drugs with a potassium-sparing effect, then potassium supplements should
be considered when bumetanide therapy is given long-term.

admission, there is no indication that warrants a need to increase the dose
or review the therapy because the drug is ineffective. The sodium chloride
infusion is required to rehydrate the patient, and should be continued until
normal urine ﬂow is achieved. The pharmacist could monitor the patient’s
progress and advise the prescribing team when to withdraw the infusion. There
is no apparent rationale for the use of haloperidol in this elderly patient. Her
state of confusion is due to her hyperglycaemic state, which has precipitated
dehydration. Correction of these complications should improve her confusion.
Haloperidol has a rapid effect on hyperactive states and initial doses may help
to calm down the patient. However, continued use may precipitate hypo-
glycaemia. Continued treatment with haloperidol should be reviewed.

Glibenclamide and gliclazide are oral sulphonylureas that are used in
diabetes to augment secretion of insulin. They are effective only in patients
with residual pancreatic beta-cell activity. Gliclazide is a shorter-acting
product. It has a duration of action of about 12 h whereas glibenclamide has
a duration of action of up to 24 h. The shorter-acting product is less likely to
cause hypoglycaemia. CA is an elderly patient, who may present with a
slower metabolism of the drug; she may be living alone and may have
problems with maintaining regular meals. The dose of glibenclamide for
elderly patients is usually 2.5 mg after breakfast.
A37 B
CA should be advised to consume small, frequent regular meals that are low
in fat and carbohydrate content. She should be educated on the foods to
include in her diet and about the importance of having a regular schedule of

JZ presents with an acute attack of gout. He is on medication to control his
hypertension and heart failure. He is taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor (enalapril), a beta-adrenoceptor blocker (atenolol), a thiazide diuretic
(bendroﬂumethiazide) and aspirin as an antiplatelet agent to prevent occur-
rence of cerebrovascular disease and myocardial infarction.
A64 A
Gout is a condition associated with either an increased production of uric acid
or a decreased excretion of uric acid. Excess uric acid in the body is converted
to sodium urate crystals that are deposited in joints, most commonly in the big
toe. Increased levels of serum uric acid may be due to excessive production
of uric acid or to excessive destruction of cells and therefore breakdown of
nucleic acids, resulting in the production of uric acid.

===== PAGE 79 =====
A65 A
Heart failure is a condition that may increase risk of hyperuricaemia. Diuretics
interfere with the excretion of uric acid and alter the concentration of uric acid
in blood. This results in precipitation of uric acid salts from the blood which
become deposited in the joints. A diet that consists of excessive consumption
of purine-rich food such as meat and organ meat increases production of uric
acid.
A66 D
An acute attack of gout is characterised by a rapid onset of pain, swelling
and inﬂammation usually affecting the ﬁrst metatarsophalangeal joint in the
big toe. Initially, the attack is monoarticular but it may progress to include other
joints. Attacks could recur with no clear provocation.
A67 D
The clinical signs are so characteristic of the condition that diagnosis could be
based on their presentation. Concentration of urate crystals in the synovial
ﬂuid of joints correlates very closely with serum levels. Serum uric acid levels
may be measured, particulary to monitor treatment. Hyperuricaemia also tends
to be present in other arthritic disease states. The erythrocyte sedimentation
rate (ESR) is a non-speciﬁc test that indicates occurrence of infection or inﬂam-
matory diseases. As it is a non-speciﬁc test, its relevance to the diagnosis of
gout is minimal.
A68 B
JZ should be advised to rest the affected joint, maintain good ﬂuid intake and
to take the prescribed drug. The use of colchicine in older people may precipi-
tate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance because of the common occurrence

of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea as side-effects. JZ should be advised to
report side-effects immediately.
A69 B
Colchicine is an effective drug, which is used in the acute management of gout
or for short-term prophylaxis during initial therapy with allopurinol or other
uricosuric agents. Its use is limited by the occurrence of side-effects, especially
at high doses or in patients with renal or hepatic disease. It produces a
dramatic response in acute gout probably by acting as an antimitotic and
inhibiting leucocyte mobility to the inﬂamed areas.
A70 A
Usually non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs are used as ﬁrst-line treatment in
the management of acute attacks of gout. They counteract the pain and reduce
the inﬂammation. JZ suffers from heart failure and colchicine is preferred to
avoid the ﬂuid retention that may occur with NSAIDs. Also, NSAIDs may
interact with the medications that JZ is taking, namely the diuretics and anti-
hypertensive agents, causing a decrease in the hypotensive effect. Although
this interaction is usually not of clinical signiﬁcance, it is worth considering
other therapeutic options. The disadvantage of colchicine is that it is commonly
associated with side-effects, particularly signs of gastrointestinal toxicity mani-
fested as diarrhoea and vomiting. Occurrence of these side-effects indicates
that the dose should be reviewed. Colchicine is associated with cumulative
toxicity and diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain are the ﬁrst
signs of toxicity. The dose should be stopped or reduced depending on the
patient’s symptoms.
A71 B
Non-steroidal drugs such as indometacin and diclofenac are considered in the
management of acute attacks of gout. Aspirin and its derivatives should be
Test 1 Answers 51


===== PAGE 81 =====
avoided during an acute attack as these agents compete with uric acid for
excretion and may worsen rather than decrease the symptoms. In fact it is
worth considering stopping the aspirin 75 mg daily dose until the acute attack
subsides. The dose is relatively low but the patient already has other factors
that may be contributing to the condition and the aspirin is used as a prophyl-
actic agent in JZ.
A72 B
Obesity, heart failure and drug therapy are all factors in JZ which increase
susceptibility to gout. JZ should be advised on how to counteract the factors
that may be corrected. He should be advised to lose weight, which will help
him to manage his cardiovascular risk better, as well as to decrease the recur-
rence of gout. He should be advised to take regular exercise that is not very
strenuous, such as short walks and to follow a healthy diet that is based on
fruit and vegetables, which will be low in purines.
A73 A
Allopurinol is used for the long-term prophylaxis of gout and is considered
for patients who have a high incidence of recurrence. It reduces uric acid
production by inhibiting the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which brings about
the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and of xanthine to uric acid. As
allopurinol may prolong an attack or precipitate it, it should not be started
during an acute attack. It should be started 2–3 weeks after the acute attack
has subsided. It is given in a once-daily dose. It has an active metabolite,
oxipurinol, which has a plasma halﬂife of 15 or more hours.
A74 A
Uricosuric drugs include sulﬁnpyrazone and probenecid. Like allopurinol, they
may be used as prophylactic agents. They should be avoided in patients with
overproduction of uric acid and are ineffective in patients with poor renal

function. They inhibit the renal tubular re-absorption of uric acid and therefore
increase urinary excretion of uric acid. Patients should be advised to consume
a good ﬂuid intake of at least two litres a day. This will decrease the risk of
uric acid stone formation.
Questions 75–80
HG suffers from Sjögren’s syndrome, a condition that is frequently associated
with rheumatoid arthritis and Raynaud’s phenomenon. The condition presents
with a deﬁcient moisture production of the lacrimal, salivary and other glands
resulting in dryness of the mouth, eyes and other mucous membranes. The
patient may also have the classic characteristics of rheumatoid arthritis. HG
is a diabetic and is taking a sulphonylurea (glimepiride) and a biguanide
(metformin). She is on a beta-blocker (atenolol) and an antiplatelet drug (dipyri-
damole) indicating possibility of a history of cardiovascular disease. She is
taking simvastatin as a lipid-regulating drug. HG has recently been diagnosed
with hypothyroidism and she was prescribed thyroxine. Her ESR is elevated
(>30 mm/h) and she is seropositive for rheumatoid factor.
A75 A
Thyroxine, levothyroxine, is a thyroid hormone used in hypothyroidism.
Because it increases metabolic rate, it should be taken in the morning to
minimise the occurrence of insomnia. Common side-effects of metformin are
gastrointestinal, such as nausea and vomiting. By taking the tablet with or after
food, these side-effects are minimised. Dipyridamole should be taken three
times daily before food, as dipyridamole is incompletely absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract.
A76 D
Hypothyroidism occurs in the older population and may have an insidious
onset. Signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism tend to be subacute and presen-
tation may be related to non-speciﬁc symptoms.

A77 D
When thyroxine is administered to patients receiving warfarin, it enhances the
anticoagulant effect of warfarin.
A78 A
Caution should be undertaken when thyroxine is started in elderly patients and
in patients with cardiovascular disorders, as there could be a rapid increase
in metabolic rate leading to problems including anginal pain, arrhythmias,
palpitations, tachycardia. In diabetic patients, caution should be used, as its
introduction may interfere with antidiabetic therapy. It should be started in
small doses at small increments.
A79 B
Side-effects resemble symptoms of hyperthyroidism and include diarrhoea,
anginal pain, tachycardia, skeletal muscle cramps, tremors, restlessness,
excitability, insomnia, headache and ﬂushing.
A80 D
The thyroid hormones T
3 and T4 are transported in the blood by three proteins:
the thyroid-binding globulin; thyroid-binding prealbumin; and albumin. Hence
the total thyroid hormones concentration in plasma changes with alterations
in amount of thyroxine-binding in plasma. Only the unbound thyroid hormone
is able to diffuse into the thyroid cell and elicit a biological response. For this
reason the concentration of total thyroid hormones in plasma is not considered
a good diagnostic marker. Laboratory investigations to diagnose and monitor
management of hypothyroidism are based on free T
3, free T4 and thyroid-stimu-
lating hormone (TSH). In the early stages of hypothyroidism, free T 3 and free
T4 concentrations may be normal and a modest increase in TSH is detected.
Free T3 and free T4 may decline as the disease progresses.

Questions 1–3
Abbreviations are commonly encountered in case notes. They are standard-
ised to help exchange of information between different health care settings
and so that case notes can be used by different health professionals.
A1 A
PMH stands for 
past medical history, where information on conditions experi-
enced previously by the patient is reported.
A2 D
PC stands for presenting complaint, where the symptoms that are reported by
the patient are included.
A3 B
O/E stands for on examination, where the information observed by health
professionals is noted.
Questions 4–6
Clinical laboratory tests are signiﬁcant in chronic disease management to
monitor outcomes of therapy and compliance with pharmacotherapy and
lifestyle measures.

BUN stands for blood urea nitrogen. It provides an indirect measure of renal
function and glomerular ﬁltration rate, and also gauges liver function. Urea is
formed in the liver as an end-product of protein metabolism. Urea is trans-
ported to the kidneys for excretion. For kidney function monitoring it should
not be used as a stand-alone test, because changes in the metabolic function
of the liver could affect the BUN results. BUN is used together with creatinine
levels in the monitoring of kidney function.
A5 C
TSH stands for 
thyroid-stimulating hormone , and its concentrations are
monitored in thyroid disease.
A6 A
HbA1c, also referred to as glycosylated haemoglobin, is used to monitor
diabetes. It measures the blood glucose bound to haemoglobin. As erythro-
cytes have a life span of 120 days, the test reﬂects the average blood sugar
level in the 2–3 months preceding the test. It gives an indication of the blood
glucose levels over the past 90 days.
Questions 7–26
A7 C
INR stands for international normalised ratio. It is a ratio value comparing a
patient’s prothrombin time against the prothrombin time of normal control
patients. It is used as a monitoring index in patients receiving warfarin. INR
levels for patients on warfarin are aimed at between two and three, depending
on the goal of treatment and other factors, such as recurrent deep vein
thrombosis or use of prosthetic heart valves.

Lung function tests involve the use of a spirometer to measure lung volumes
and air ﬂow rates. Measurements include forced expiratory volume, vital
capacity, forced vital capacity and residual volume. Lung function tests are
used to determine the severity of the respiratory disease and to monitor
outcomes of therapy. Patients may be educated to use a patient-friendly
spirometer device to monitor their condition and adjust their therapy accord-
ingly as advised by the healthcare team. Lung function tests may be used to
determine the reversibility of airway disease. Sometimes a bronchodilator may
be administered before the procedure after baseline pulmonary function tests
have been carried out, to evaluate the degree of disease reversibility.
A9 B
Heart failure results in a reduced cardiac output leading to impaired oxygena-
tion and a compromised blood supply to muscles. A common cause of heart
failure is left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Sustained heart failure results in
compensatory mechanisms by the body to maintain circulation. These result in
long-term sequelae such as remodelling of the left ventricle and cardiac
enlargement. A chest radiograph may reveal an enlarged cardiac shadow
and consolidation in the lungs. Due to the occurrence of cardiomegaly,
arrhythmias may occur. Patients with heart failure present with dyspnoea or
orthopnoea, may appear pale and may have cold extremities.
A10 E
Colonoscopy is a diagnostic procedure that is used in the assessment of gastro-
intestinal disorders of the colon. It may be used to diagnose inﬂammatory
bowel disease and carcinoma. It is used to assess the management of patients
with inflammatory bowel disease; for example, in patients who have
undergone surgery for ulcerative colitis, regular colonoscopy is undertaken to
evaluate recurrence of the disease. It is also used as a diagnostic screening
tool in familial colon cancer. It may be repeated as necessary. A disadvantage

is that bowel cleansing is required before the procedure and if this is not done
efﬁciently then the results are compromised.
A11 E
EEG stands for electroencephalography and it is a test carried out to measure
and record electrical impulses in the brain. It is used to diagnose seizures.
However the EEG has limitations and patients with epilepsy may present with
a normal EEG, but the EEG helps in classifying seizures. The procedure may
be carried out in a sleep-induced state or in a sleep-deprived state.
A12 B
Arterial pressure reﬂects the stress exerted by the circulating blood on the
arterial walls. It is directly related to the cardiac output and the systemic
vascular resistance. In chronically elevated arterial blood pressure, direct
organ and vascular damage may result, caused by increased peripheral
resistance and by arteriosclerosis. Organs commonly affected include the
heart, kidneys, brain and retina. Manifestations of the sustained damage are
renovascular disease, such as renal failure; cerebrovascular disease, such as
thrombotic stroke; retinal damage resulting in visual defects; and cardio-
vascular disease, such as ischaemic heart disease.
A13 B
Atherosclerosis is a common arterial disorder characterised by deposits of
plaques consisting of cholesterol, lipids and cellular debris on the inner layers
of walls of large- and medium-sized arteries. It may occur in any artery and
increases the risk of thrombosis. It is a cause of coronary artery disease,
angina and myocardial infarction. Its occurrence increases with age and is
related to smoking, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and elevated low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.

Angina pectoris is thoracic pain, most often caused by myocardial anoxia.
Symptoms of angina pectoris may occur with activities or circumstances that
increase cardiac workload such as: exertion following exercise, like climbing
stairs; emotion, such as anxiety, which results in an increased heart rate; heavy
meals, because of the requirement of increased gastrointestinal perfusion; and
exposure to cold temperatures owing to peripheral vasoconstriction, which
leads to increased peripheral resistance.
A15 C
A myocardial infarction occurs because of a coronary vessel occlusion for a
duration of about 6 h. Infarct size may be limited by dilatation of neighbour-
ing vessels brought about by a mechanism of autoregulation. Myocardial
infarction is caused by atherosclerosis and the patient presents with severe,
crushing, retrosternal pain. In the absence of complications, patients resume
mobilisation within 2 or 3 days of a myocardial infarction. Subsequently
patients should be advised to follow a healthy diet which is low in fats, to
undertake routine exercise and to attain a normal body weight. They should
be reassured that a gradual re-establishment of normal activity will be
achieved. Family and friends should be counselled how to help the patient
achieve this.
A16 B
Gallstones consist of cholesterol and bile pigments that are calciﬁed. Common
complications of gallstones include biliary colic, cholestatic jaundice, acute
pancreatitis and acute cholecystitis and cholangitis. In biliary colic the patient
complains of moderate to severe pain in the epigastric area. Jaundice occurs
because of obstruction of the bile ducts and presents with generalised pruritus.
In acute pancreatitis there is reﬂux of the bile up the pancreatic duct and it
causes pain and vomiting. Acute cholecystitis and cholangitis are due to
inﬂammation of the gall bladder and common bile duct.

In osteoarthritis degenerative changes including subchondral bony sclerosis,
loss of articular cartilage and proliferation of bone spurs occur in one or many
joints. As the disease progresses inﬂammation of the synovial membrane takes
place. The disease is not reversible except where joint replacement is under-
taken. However, disease progression is very gradual and patients should be
advised how to rest and support involved joints through proper physiotherapist-
guided exercises. Losing weight helps to reduce stress on the joints.
A18 C
A major disadvantage of cytotoxic chemotherapy is that it interferes with
cellular activity in cancerous and normal tissues. It is associated with unwanted
effects because of its effect on normal cells. Nausea and vomiting after
treatment are very common side-effects. Their extent depends on the emeto-
genic potential of the drugs used. When these side-effects are not very well
controlled, there is a risk that the patient develops anticipatory nausea and
vomiting before treatment. However, this effect is psychologically and not
chemically induced. Alopecia, which is usually reversible, is another common
side-effect. Because of the suppressive effects on the bone-marrow caused by
cytotoxic chemotherapy, patients are prone to develop infections. Patients
should be advised to report any signs of an infection, such as sore throat or
fever, to a health professional.
A19 D
When there is temporary loss of consciousness leading to a fall, it may indicate
a brief cerebral hypoxia, which could be caused by a number of factors
including emotional stress, vascular pooling in the legs, diaphoresis or a
sudden change in body position. Such an incident may also indicate serious
disease states, such as brain tumours. The patient should be assessed and
medical and drug histories should be reviewed.

Hypokalaemia is a decreased serum potassium level. Normally the potassium
loss from the body through renal and faecal excretion and from loss in sweat
is miminal. Hypokalaemia may result because of a high loss from the gastro-
intestinal tract, as gastrointestinal secretions contain high levels of potassium.
Vomiting, diarrhoea and laxative abuse could result in hypokalaemia. An
increased renal clearance due to drugs, alkalosis and aldosteronism may also
result in hypokalaemia. Drugs that could induce hypokalaemia include
thiazide and loop diuretics and steroids. Hyperkalaemia is the excess of
potassium in serum. It is commonly caused by renal failure.
A21 A
Hypoglycaemia is a blood glucose level below 3 mmol/l. It is a condition that
develops rapidly and usually occurs in diabetics either because of an excessive
antidiabetic dose or owing to changes in lifestyle. Patients should be educated
to identify symptoms of hypoglycaemia so that they can counteract it by taking
carbohydrates, to prevent neuroglycopenic symptoms such as drowsiness,
disorientation and confusion progressing to convulsions, coma and death.
Symptoms of hypoglycaemia indicating an activated sympathetic nervous
system are sweating, tremor, pallor and anxiety. Other effects are hunger,
blurred vision, salivation and weakness.

microvascular damage in the retina causing dilatation, haemorrhage and
infarction leading to retinopathy. Retinopathy is managed with laser photo-
coagulation. Its occurrence is usually associated with diabetic nephropathy.
Nephropathy occurs because of sclerosis of the glomerular basement
membrane. Initial signs of nephropathy are microalbuminuria, proteinuria and
hypertension. ACE inhibitors are used in diabetic patients to treat hypertension
as well as to dilate intrarenal vessels and thus minimise glomerular hyper-
tension. Macroangiopathy occurs in cardiac vessels leading to onset of
ischaemic heart disease. To decrease the effects of macroangiopathy, lipid-
lowering drugs such as statins are considered in diabetic patients.
A24 A
Normal saline consists of 0.9% sodium chloride as an isotonic solution. It is
used as a parenteral preparation in electrolyte and ﬂuid imbalance such as
sodium depletion. It is also available as nasal drops in nasal congestion and
as a nebuliser diluent. It may be used in eye and wound irrigation and for
oral hygiene.
A25 A
Topical administration of corticosteroids in the eye is associated with thinning
of the cornea and sclera, steroid glaucoma and steroid cataract. These side-
effects occur particularly after prolonged use. The use of a topical preparation
containing only a corticosteroid in a patient presenting with a red eye may
lead to aggravation of the underlying infection resulting in corneal ulceration
with a possible loss of vision.

recommended. Patients on antihypertensive agents complaining of nasal
congestion may be recommended a topical sympathomimetic drug such as
xylometazoline, which will act as a vasoconstrictor and reduce the congestion
with minimal systemic effects. Patients presenting with allergic rhinitis could
be recommended use of systemic non-sedating antihistamine drugs such as
loratidine.

AB is an elderly male patient with congestive heart failure, hypertension and
diabetes. On admission he is taking bumetanide (a loop diuretic), potassium
chloride, isosorbide dinitrate (a nitrate), atenolol (a beta-adrenoceptor drug),
aspirin (an antiplatelet), lorazepam (an anti-anxiety drug) and metoclopramide
(an anti-emetic). Potassium chloride, isosorbide dinitrate and bumetanide may
cause nausea, though it is not a common side-effect. This may be the rationale
behind the use of metoclopramide at night. On admission he presents with
symptoms of deterioration of congestive heart failure, a high blood pressure
and an elevated fasting blood glucose level.
A27 C
AB has diabetes mellitus and congestive heart failure. In elderly and diabetic
patients it is very common to ﬁnd multiple disease states. Metabolic stress such
as deterioration of congestive heart failure may precipitate an acute distur-
bance in diabetic control. In AB even though there is an elevated fasting blood
glucose level, this should be monitored but no therapeutic action should be
taken until his cardiac condition is stabilised.
A28 B
In congestive heart failure there is generalised oedema and usually the term
implies bilateral failure resulting in reduced cardiac contractility. Symptoms

include oedema, dyspnoea (sensation of uncomfortable breathing) and
fatigue.
A29 B
Bumetanide is a loop diuretic, which acts by inhibiting re-absorption from the
ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the renal tubule. It has an onset of
action within 1 h of oral administration and a duration of action of about 6 h.
With regular use the impact on frequency of diuresis after drug administration
tends to decrease. One of the side-effects of bumetanide is the development
of hypokalaemia. Potassium supplements are administered to counteract this
unwanted effect. Loop diuretics are used in the management of heart failure
as they provide a symptomatic relief from the oedema. They reduce circulat-
ing blood volume and therefore decrease preload and afterload in the heart.
They do not have an impact on disease progression. Had oedema been severe
in AB on admission, changing bumetanide to an intravenous administration
for a few days until oedema is decreased could have been an option.
A30 B
Isosorbide dinitrate is a nitrate that is used in the prophylaxis and treatment
of angina and in left ventricular failure. In AB isosorbide dinitrate is being
used for the management of heart failure. Nitrates cause vasodilatation and
lead to a decrease in preload. Isosorbide dinitrate is metabolised to active
metabolites, the most important of which is isosorbide mononitrate. It is
available as short-acting tablets which may also be used sublingually in
angina, as an aerosol spray, as modiﬁed-release oral dosage forms and as
injection for intravenous infusion. The dose for isosorbide dinitrate in heart
failure is 30–160 mg in divided doses but the dose may be increased to
240 mg daily.

Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker that is used in hyper-
tension and in angina. The recommended daily dose for atenolol in hyper-
tension is 25–100 mg, although the 50 mg dose is usually adequate. As a
beta-blocker it may mask symptoms of hypoglycaemia. However, this is of no
concern in AB as the patient is not taking any antidiabetic agents but is control-
ling diabetes through diet. Beta-blockers have negative inotropic properties
and therefore may cause bradycardia and they should not be used in patients
with uncontrolled heart failure. Treatment with beta-blockers such as atenolol
should be started with care in patients with heart failure. It has been demon-
strated that three beta-blockers namely bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol
reduce heart failure disease progression, decrease symptoms and mortality
when used in stable heart failure. In AB it is an option to consider changing
atenolol to an alternative therapeutic approach which better tackles the
concomitant occurrence of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Use of
one of these three beta-blockers (bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol) is an
option.

Lorazepam is a short-acting benzodiazepine that has anti-anxiety and hypnotic
properties. Use of benzodiazepines in older people is associated with alter-
ations in the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug that lead to clinical
consequences such as drowsiness, confusion and ataxia (a condition charac-
terised by an inability to coordinate movement). The probability of occurrence
of these side-effects is higher with drugs that have a long halﬂife. The use of
lorazepam in AB raises concern as it appears that there is no clear rationale
for its use. More data is required as to reasons for its use and duration of
therapy. It may have been started recently when the patient was becoming
agitated because of the insidious deterioration of his wellbeing. Owing to the
onset of benzodiazepine dependence, lorazepam should not be stopped
abruptly if the patient has been taking the drug for a few weeks. Abrupt with-
drawal is associated with the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome charac-
terised by anxiety, depression, impaired concentration, insomnia, headache
and loss of appetite.

Enalapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which causes
a decreased arterial and venous vasoconstriction and a decreased blood
volume. ACE inhibitors are considered as ﬁrst-line therapy in the management
of heart failure because it has been shown that they reduce symptoms and
improve prognosis. They are also used in hypertension as they reduce salt and
water retention. The addition of enalapril to AB’s therapy was an important
therapeutic intervention undertaken during hospitalisation. Before admission
the patient had a deterioration in the heart failure condition and required
further therapeutic intervention to correct progression of the disease. By
choosing to include enalapril in AB’s therapy, the ﬁrst-line management of
congestive heart failure is now being followed.
A34 A
ACE inhibitors may cause a rapid fall in blood pressure. This may be quite
relevant to AB as the patient is already being administered other drugs that
have a hypotensive effect. For this reason, the ﬁrst dose of ACE inhibitors
should preferably be started at night so that the risk of injury caused by
hypotension is lower because the patient is lying in bed. ACE inhibitors may
cause hyperkalaemia and in fact the potassium chloride supplement has been
stopped. ACE inhibitors may cause a deterioration in renal function, especi-
ally in patients with pre-existing disease, hypovolaemia and heart failure.
When initiating treatment in AB, blood pressure, serum potassium levels and
renal function should be monitored.
A35 A
Upon discharge, the changes carried out in his medications should be
discussed with AB. It should be particularly pointed out that atenolol and
potassium chloride have been stopped and instead enalapril has to be taken
daily at night. AB should be advised to use the metoclopramide only when he
has symptoms of nausea.

Regarding bumetanide, AB should be advised to take one tablet daily in the
morning to avoid waking up at night because of the increased diuresis that it
causes. Bumetanide is almost completely and quite rapidly absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract and there is no need to advise patients to take the drug
on an empty stomach.
A37 A
Tolerance is associated with nitrates. By reducing the nitrate concentration
levels during the night, occurrence of tolerance is reduced and effectiveness
maintained. Patient should receive the three doses between 7 am and 6 pm.
A38 A
Monitoring the outcome of therapy in AB is based on the measurement of
blood pressure, the assessment of development of oedema and dyspnoea, and
the measurement of blood glucose levels and HbA1c. A lipid proﬁle and renal
function tests could be carried out from time to time as well.
Questions 39–40
XY presents with cellulitis, which is an acute infection of the skin and sub-
cutaneous tissue. It is characterised by erythema, oedema, swelling and pain
and may be sometimes associated with fever, malaise and headache. Occur-
rence of the condition is higher where there is damaged skin, compromised
circulation and in diabetics. The infection is commonly caused by Gram-
positive cocci. Penicillins are the preferred antibacterial agents as ﬁrst-line
treatment.
Test 2: Answers 97


===== PAGE 127 =====
A39 B
In penicillin-allergic patients, macrolides are usually the preferred drugs.
Alternatively, a cephalosporin such as cefuroxime may be used with care.
Some patients who are sensitive to penicillins may be also cephalosporin
hypersensitive. Cephalosporins have a similar spectrum of activity to penicillins
and macrolides and are usually effective against Gram-positive cocci. Cefur-
oxime is a second generation cephalosporin that is less susceptible to inacti-
vation by beta-lactamases compared with ﬁrst-generation cephalosporins.
Flucloxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin. Nalidixic acid is a quinolone
with activity predominantly against Gram-negative bacteria. Fluconazole is
a triazole antifungal agent and isoniazid is an antituberculous drug. In
cellulitis, when therapy is unsuccessful or inadvisable because of drug sensi-
tivity, vancomycin may be considered.
A40 B
Hypersensitivity reactions may occur with any antibacterial agent. They are
more commonly recognised with penicillins. Hypersensitivity reactions vary in
presentation and may include development of a rash, an urticarial rash, fever
or an acute anaphylactic reaction. Onset of allergic reaction may occur up to
14 days from ﬁrst dose administration.
Questions 41–42
PS is taking diazepam, which is a benzodiazepine, and amitriptyline, which
is a tricylic antidepressant. Tricyclic antidepressants may cause movement
disorders and dyskinesias. There are few reports where patients using benzo-
diazepines developed extrapyramidal symptoms. Elderly patients may be
particularly sensitive to the side-effects of benzodiazepines and tricyclic anti-
depressants; low doses should be used. PS is receiving the maximum dose
recommended for elderly patients for amitriptyline and the lowest recom-
mended dose for the use of diazepam in insomnia.

PS has developed tardive dyskinesia, which is characterised by involuntary
repetitive movements of muscles in the face, limbs and trunk. They may occur
as a drug-induced side-effect after prolonged therapy and elderly patients are
more prone to their occurrence. Withdrawal of the causative agent may result
in an improvement in the condition after some time.
A42 C
Venlafaxine and reboxetine are antidepressant drugs that are less likely to be
associated with the development of movement disorders. Venlafaxine is a
serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor, whereas reboxetine is a
selective inhibitor of noradrenaline. Both drugs should be used with care in
patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, urinary retention,
prostatic hypertrophy, glaucoma, renal and hepatic impairment.
Questions 43–47
QR is an elderly patient who is taking a compound preparation of codeine
and paracetamol (co-codamol), paracetamol, gliclazide (sulphonylurea),
ferrous sulphate, dipyridamole (antiplatelet) and isosorbide dinitrate (nitrate).
A medication review is required.
A43 B
Co-codamol is a compound preparation containing paracetamol, a non-opioid
analgesic, and codeine, an opioid analgesic. At the same time that he is taking
this product, QR is also taking paracetamol tablets. There is overlap of therapy
which could result in overdosage with paracetamol and use of codeine may
lead to constipation. Pharmacist should advise QR to stop the co-codamol and
continue taking only two paracetamol tablets every four hours. When normal-
release ferrous sulphate tablets are used, the dose of 200 mg three times daily

===== PAGE 129 =====
is recommended. For modiﬁed-release preparations, one or two tablets daily
are taken. Hence the product that is being used by QR should be veriﬁed and
the dose adjusted accordingly. QR could be advised to take the ferrous
sulphate tablets after meals so as to decrease the occurrence of gastrointestinal
irritation. QR is receiving daily 60 mg of isosorbide dinitrate, which is within
the recommended dosage for isosorbide dinitrate (up to a maximum dose of
240 mg).
A44 D
The maximum adult dose of paracetamol is 4 g, administered as 0.5–1 g
every 4–6 h. Overdosage with paracetamol leads to hepatic damage, which
may have a delayed presentation of up to 6 days. The resulting hepatic
damage may lead to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia,
cerebral oedema and death. The hepatic damage is caused by a hydroxyl-
ated metabolite, 
N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine, which is usually produced in
very small amounts and is detoxiﬁed by conjugation with gluthatione. In over-
dosage the amount of this metabolite exceeds the gluthatione potential for
detoxiﬁcation.
A45 A
Gliclazide is a sulphonylurea that is used as an oral antidiabetic agent. It
increases insulin secretion from functioning islet beta cells in the pancreas.
Gliclazide may be used in combination with metformin (biguanide) and
acarbose. Side-effects that may occur include mild gastrointestinal distur-
bances such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation. They increase
appetite and weight gain may occur. Hypoglycaemia may occur and this is
relatively uncommon unless associated with overdosage or skipped meals.

QR should be advised on healthy lifestyle measures to counteract complica-
tions associated with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. These include

avoided. QR has a higher risk of developing atherosclerosis and he should
receive advice to follow a low-fat diet.
A47 A
QR is receiving analgesics (paracetamol), an antiplatelet agent (dipyrid-
amole), and a nitrate (isosorbide dinitrate), which promote coronary vaso-
dilation. Patient should be asked to visit health professionals regularly to have
blood glucose levels, glycosylated haemoglobin, blood pressure and lipid
proﬁle assessed.
Questions 48–51
MR is receiving treatment for glaucoma with dorzolamide and acetazolamide
(carbonic anhydrase inhibitors) and timolol (beta-blocker). She is receiving
ranitidine, an H
2-receptor antagonist and bisacodyl which is a stimulant
laxative. MR is also receiving framycetin eye drops as an antibacterial
preparation.
A48 B
Bisacodyl is a diphenylmethane stimulant laxative and it acts mainly on the
large intestine. Prolonged use of bisacodyl should be avoided as it may precip-
itate diarrhoea, hypokalaemia and atonic non-functioning colon. It may be
used for the short-term management of constipation and its advantage is that
it is very rapid in action. It should be avoided in intestinal obstruction and it
may cause abdominal discomfort such as colic and cramps.
A49 E

not include ﬁbre in their diets. The problem is even more prominent if the
patient is bedridden. Lactulose, which is an osmotic laxative, is a semi-synthetic
disaccharide which is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It can be
used in the long-term management of constipation. Senna and docusate
sodium are very similar to bisacodyl. They are also stimulant laxatives.
Magnesium hydroxide is not indicated for regular use. It is absorbed system-
ically, causes signiﬁcant bowel evacuation and may cause dehydration and
electrolyte imbalance. Use of liquid parafﬁn as a laxative is not recommended
as oral administration results in anal seepage and irritation and it may give
rise to foreign-body granulomatous reactions.
A50 A
Framycetin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial agent which has a bactericidal
action against Gram-negative aerobic bacteria excluding 
Pseudomonas
species and against some strains of staphylococci. As it is not absorbed from
the gastrointestinal tract, it is used as a topical agent in skin, eye and ear
infections. Usually in eye infections, topical administration of antibacterial
drugs results in a positive outcome. Topical antibacterials, including
framycetin, may be used for prophylaxis following ophthalmic surgical inter-
ventions. The antibacterials are used for acute management or for short-term
use in prophylaxis.
A51 E
MR is receiving treatment for glaucoma, which is a raised intraocular pressure
caused by obstruction of the outﬂow of aqueous humour. It is presented with
loss of visual ﬁeld. Drug therapy is aimed at decreasing intraocular pressure.
Timolol, a beta-blocker, reduces intraocular pressure by reducing the rate of
production of aqueous humour. Dorzolamide and acetazolamide are carbonic
anhydrase inhibitors, which again interfere with the production of aqueous
humour by inhibiting the enzyme involved in the process. Dorzolamide and
timolol are applied topically, whereas acetazolamide is administered system-
ically. In glaucoma, drug therapy usually starts with monotherapy, usually

intraocular pressure and symptom reduction occur.
Questions 52–53
The term chest infection is usually used to refer to a lower respiratory tract
infection. CB is receiving lactulose as a laxative, warfarin as an oral anti-
coagulant and paracetamol as an analgesic when required. CB has ear
problems with tinnitus and hearing loss.
A52 D
Ciproﬂoxacin is a quinolone that is active against Gram-positive and Gram-
negative bacteria. It is an appropriate preparation for CB. A macrolide
product such as clarithromycin is also a suitable option. As CB has a history
of penicillin sensitivity, co-amoxiclav and cefuroxime should be avoided.
Cefuroxime is a cephalosporin and cross-sensitivity with penicillins is possible.
Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside that is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal
tract and requires parenteral administration. Its use in CB is not recommended
when there are other options because it may cause otoxocity as a side-effect,
resulting in a deterioration in CB’s ear disorders. Sodium fusidate is a narrow-
spectrum product that is indicated in penicillin-resistant staphylococci infections
such as osteomyelitis and in staphylococcal endocarditis.
A53 C
Lactulose is a semi-synthetic disaccharide that produces osmotic diarrhoea. It
can be used for the management of chronic constipation. Its use in the acute

In the terminal stages of carcinoma, pain may occur because of disease
progression, the debility it causes and owing to co-existing conditions. The
pathophysiology of pain in terminal carcinoma may be multiple because of
the varied factors leading to its occurrence. In breast cancer, bone metastases
are quite common. A multidisciplinary approach should be adopted in pallia-
tive care. The pharmacist could monitor the use of drugs to maintain the patient
as pain free as possible and to manage other problems such as the nausea
that may arise.
A54 C
Co-codamol consists of a mixture of paracetamol, a non-opioid and codeine,
an opioid drug. Codeine is effective for the relief of mild to moderate pain.
An opioid drug such as morphine is required for JM. Tramadol is an opioid
analgesic that is associated with fewer side-effects compared with other
opioid drugs. However its use may increase risk of CNS toxicity when used
together with SSRIs. Aspirin and ibuprofen are non-opioid drugs that have an
anti-inﬂammatory and an analgesic effect. They may be of value in patients
with bone pain and may be used in addition to an opioid analgesic. Domperi-
done is used as an anti-emetic drug. It may be required with the use of opioid
drugs.

A57 A
Paroxetine is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is used in JM
to alleviate depression and anxiety associated with terminal carcinoma.
Paroxetine should be administered in the morning to minimise insomnia,
anxiety and nervousness during the night. Common side-effects of SSRIs are
nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea or constipation.
Occurrence of these side-effects is reduced by administering the drug with or
after food.
A58 E
Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that is associated with tolerance and depen-
dence. The occurrence of dependence results in withdrawal symptoms, should
the drug be discontinued abruptly. However, these disadvantages are not of
concern in the management of JM. The aim is to keep JM pain free and in a
relatively good mental state. The advantage of using diazepam as an anxio-
lytic outweighs the disadvantages of tolerance and dependence. A disadvan-
tage of diazepam which is of concern in JM is the occurrence of confusion.
Questions 59–60
LX is taking dipyridamole (antiplatelet), aspirin (antiplatelet) and glibenclamide
(antidiabetic agent). A complication of diabetes mellitus is vascular disease in
the peripheries, which predisposes patients to the development of an infection
following trauma to the area. This occurs very commonly in the feet, a
condition referred to as the diabetic foot. For this reason diabetics are advised
to take good care of their feet, avoid injuries and foot maceration from
footwear. Diabetics should immediately seek advice about injuries to the feet
to avoid development of infections in the area.

Morphine is an opioid analgesic that is widely used in the management of
moderate to severe pain. It is the standard drug against which other opioid
analgesics are compared. It is particularly useful in postoperative analgesia

CP is receiving gliclazide (sulphonylurea), esomeprazole (proton pump
inhibitor) and an antacid preparation. From this medication proﬁle it is under-
stood that CP is a diabetic. He has a history of duodenal ulcer disease. In the
majority of cases this is caused by the organism 
Helicobacter pylori and a
triple-therapy eradication regimen is recommended in these cases. However,
in some patients there may be other factors that lead to duodenal ulceration.
These include use of non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
family history, especially when it occurs at an early age such as in the case
of CP.

In CP a cause of anaemia is gastrointestinal haemorrhage, a complication of
gastric or duodenal ulcer disease, which may occur either as a minor chronic
blood loss leading eventually to anaemia or as moderate bleeding leading to
melaena or haematemesis. The bleeding results because of erosion of an ulcer
into an artery.

A priority in the management of CP is to correct the anaemia by administer-
ing iron supplements. Iron salts should be administered by the oral route, unless
this has been unsuccessful because of non-compliance, intolerance to side-
effects, malabsorption and continued blood loss. CP should be started on

ferrous sulphate tablets and haemoglobin levels monitored. Iron is absorbed
mostly as the ferrous state in an acidic environment and hence absorption
takes place mostly in the stomach. Modiﬁed-release preparations are not
recommended for CP as they do not undergo sufﬁcient dissolution until
reaching the small intestines where absorption of iron is poor. Absorption may
be reduced by food; however, many patients experience nausea and
diarrhoea when iron is administered on an empty stomach.
A65 B
CP should be advised to avoid non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs such as
aspirin and to inform prescribers and pharmacists of his condition before using
other medications. NSAIDs are very likely to cause gastrointestinal distress and
precipitate an acute attack. He should be advised to take regular small meals,
avoid strong tea, coffee and spicy food and limit food intake late at night as
this increases nocturnal gastric secretion. Anxiety, stress, alcohol and smoking
all contribute to precipitate duodenal ulcer disease.
Questions 66–72
MC is receiving treatment for diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure and
ischaemic heart disease. She also has a history of dementia. She is taking
perindopril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor), digoxin (cardiac
glycoside), bumetanide (loop diuretic), metformin (biguanide), amitriptyline
(tricyclic antidepressant) and ranitidine (H
2-receptor antagonist). MC is
presenting poor respiratory effort, sparse bilateral inspiratory crackles and
poor general health, indicating the possibility of an underlying infection. The
white blood cell count indicates that there is no leucocytosis. However, in
elderly patients, bacterial infections may not necessarily induce leucocytosis.

support ﬂuid and electrolyte loss, such as heat exposure caused by hot temper-
atures and inadequate ventilation at home. Amitriptyline may cause dry mouth
and sweating but these effects are not related to sufﬁcient ﬂuid loss to cause
dehydration.
A67 E
In elderly patients a normal white blood cell count is not sufﬁcient to eliminate
the presence of an infection and MC has clinical signs that may indicate an
infection. MC should be started on co-amoxiclav therapy intravenously. When
her general condition and the respiratory features improve, treatment may be
continued orally. The use of corticosteroids without the use of anti-infective
agents will present a general improvement in MC but will leave the infection
untreated. This is very dangerous and should be avoided.
A68 A
When MC is started on parenteral rehydration with intravenous 0.9% sodium
chloride 1 litre alternating with 5% dextrose 1 litre every 8 h, blood sodium
levels and blood glucose should be monitored. The bumetanide should be
stopped until dehydration status is corrected, and then it should be re-
introduced carefully. MC was started on sodium chloride and dextrose as she
has combined electrolyte and ﬂuid deﬁciency. Dextrose used alone is intended
when there is ﬂuid loss without signiﬁcant loss of electrolytes. This is very
uncommon.
A69 B
Metformin is an antidiabetic drug that has the advantages that it does not
increase appetite and that occurrence of hypoglycaemia is very low. Its disad-
vantage is that it may provoke lactic acidosis, especially in patients with renal

symptoms of lactic acidosis should be noted as dehydration poses a higher
risk of lactic acidosis. Side-effects of metformin include anorexia, nausea,

===== PAGE 139 =====
vomiting, abdominal pain. To reduce gastrointestinal symptoms, the patient
should be advised to take the drug with meals. Diarrhoea may occur initially
and is only transient. When alcohol is consumed with metformin, the risk of
lactic acidosis is increased. MC should be advised to avoid alcohol as it may
interfere with her medications, it may precipitate dehydration and cause a
deterioration in her general condition because of her dementia.
A70 A
Amitriptyline and imipramine are tricyclic antidepressants that have a tertiary
amine structure. Imipramine is a dibenzazepine with a structure that is very
similar to the phenothiazines, whereas amitriptyline is a dibenzocyclohepta-
diene that has a structure which resembles thioxanthenes. Amitriptyline is more
sedative than imipramine. Tolerance to this effect tends to develop with long-
term treatment. Elderly patients may be particularly sensitive to the side-effects
of tricyclic antidepressants and reduced doses are recommended. MC is
taking a dose of 20 mg at night, probably to induce sleep and reduce anxiety.
The dose is appropriate for the age group. Use of amitriptyline in MC requires
review as its use may result in cardiotoxicity and it may alter blood-glucose
concentrations, which may include hypoglycaemia unawareness. It may also
cause confusion, which is a problem in MC as she also has dementia.

combination with tremor at rest that disappears with activity and muscular
rigidity. Postural instability is a late feature of the condition and increases the
tendency to fall. As the disease progresses, patients develop reduced blink
frequency, monotonous and impaired speech, greasy skin leading to sebor-

Questions 73–75
Eczema is a chronic inﬂammatory skin condition. Atopic eczema occurs mostly
in children and it is characterised by pruritus, itchy papules, inﬂamed and
licheniﬁed skin especially on ﬂexures such as elbows and knees. It is associ-
ated with a family history of asthma and hayfever and it may be exacerbated
by allergens. The area may become infected because of pruritus, leading to
a ﬂare-up of the condition and a bacterial infection. Common causative
bacteria include staphylococci and streptococci.

In the management of an acute attack of atopic eczema, topical corticosteroids
should be recommended. The use of 1% hydrocortisone cream is a suitable
choice for BC considering that she is a child and it is a mild steroid which is
rarely associated with side-effects. In addition as there is a very high proba-
bility that BC also has impetigo, a topical anti-infective agent such as fusidic
acid, which is effective against Gram-positive cocci, could be administered.
Topical antihistamines such as mepyramine should be avoided in eczema as
they may cause hypersensitivity reactions and exacerbate the condition.
Miconazole cream is an antifungal cream which is indicated for use in fungal
skin infections.

Parents of BC should be educated on the importance of preventing dehydra-
tion of the skin by ensuring good hydration and by using emollients. They

condition may be exacerbated by allergens such as wool, excipients in
cosmetic cream preparations, and by sun exposure. They should be advised
to use a hypoallergenic sun protection cream.

the patient to identify activities that precipitate an attack, physical therapy such
as heat application to the head and neck area, and relaxation techniques.

A76 D
Tension headaches tend to occur repeatedly in patients who are prone to
develop this syndrome. Females experience this condition to a greater extent
than males. It may occur at any age and arises because of prolonged contrac-
tion of the head and neck muscles. Arterial vasoconstriction in the brain is
associated with the prodromal effects of migraine. The vasoconstriction is
followed with vasodilation and inﬂammation leading to pain associated with
a migraine attack.
A77 A
Patients with tension headache complain of mild, dull ache that is steady and
usually bilateral and non-throbbing. There is scalp tenderness and tightness.
They may have sound intolerance and pain may radiate to occipital and
frontal areas and neck.
A78 D
GM should be advised to identify factors that are precipitating her attacks.
These could include prolonged posture posing strain on head and neck
muscles and activities that induce stress. She could be advised to take up some
physical activity that will help her to relax. Speciﬁc food consumption has not
been established to have a direct effect on the occurrence of tension
headache. It has been documented that dietary factors such as consumption
of cheese and wine may induce migraine attacks.
A79 B
Drugs that can be used to manage an acute attack include paracetamol, non-
steroidal analgesics (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and combination products
such as co-codamol, which contains paracetamol and codeine. NSAIDs
and products consisting of paracetamol with an opioid drug such as the
Test 2: Answers 113


===== PAGE 143 =====
co-codamol combination present a better analgesic proﬁle. NSAIDs are anti-
inﬂammatory and this may help in patients where neck muscle inﬂammation
is prominent.
A80 C
Aspirin should not be recommended to GM if she has a history of gastric
irritation or if she is breast-feeding. Irritation of the gastric mucosa leading to
erosion and ulceration may occur with administration of aspirin and other
NSAIDs; the risk is higher in patients with a history of dyspepsia or a lesion
of the gastric mucosa. When used during breast-feeding, aspirin enters breast
milk and it is transferred to the infant. Aspirin should be avoided during breast-
feeding because there is a risk of Reye’s syndrome in the infant. Reye’s
syndrome is a condition characterised by acute encephalopathy and fatty
degeneration of the liver that is associated with the use of aspirin in children.
Regular use of aspirin by breast-feeding mothers may impair platelet function
in the infant resulting in hypoprothrombinaemia. Aspirin or other NSAIDs
should not be recommended if GM had haemophilia, as it increases the risk
of bleeding, and if GM had asthma, as hypersensitivity and paroxysmal
bronchospasms may be precipitated.

Answers
Questions 1–3
An understanding of pathology of disease states is essential to be able to use
drug therapy appropriately and rationally. Unwanted effects of medications
may have an impact in a particular patient because of concomitant disease
states, resulting in deterioration of the condition.
A1 D
Wilson’s disease is a rare disorder associated with a decrease in cerulo-
plasmin, which causes copper to accumulate slowly in the liver and then be
released into the circulation where it is taken up by other tissues. It is an
inherited disorder. Accumulation of copper in the brain causes tremors, muscle
rigidity and speech impairment, whereas its accumulation in erythrocytes leads
to haemolysis and haemolytic anaemia.
A2 B
Cushing’s disease is a disorder where there is an increased secretion of
adrenocortical steroids. This results in accumulation of fat on the face, chest
and upper back and leads to the development of oedema, hyperglycaemia,
increased gluconeogenesis, muscle weakness and osteoporosis. In women,
acne and facial hair growth may occur. The condition is caused by increased
amounts of adrenocorticotrophic hormone, which is released from the pituitary.
A3 A
Phaeochromocytoma is a tumour of the chromafﬁn tissue of the adrenal
medulla or sympathetic paraganglia. Its occurrence results in hypersecretion
143


===== PAGE 173 =====
of adrenaline and noradrenaline leading to the development of persistent or
intermittent hypertension, headache, palpitations, sweating, hyperglycaemia,
syncope, nausea and vomiting.
Questions 4–6
Serum electrolytes are regularly performed in a battery of clinical laboratory
tests. A change in the concentration of electrolytes in blood is important
information that is required for diagnosis and for patient monitoring.
A4 C
Hypercalcaemia usually occurs as a result of hyperparathyroidism or because
of carcinoma. The serum calcium measurement is used to evaluate parathyroid
function and calcium metabolism. Hyperparathyroidism leads to increased
parathyroid hormone levels, which lead to increased gastrointestinal
absorption of calcium, decreased calcium urinary excretion and increased
bone resorption. Symptoms of hypercalcaemia include nausea, vomiting,
somnolence and coma.
A5 E
Hypokalaemia leads to decreased contractility of smooth, skeletal and cardiac
muscle. This predisposes the patient to weakness, paralysis and cardiac
arrhythmias.
A6 E
Hypokalaemia increases cardiac muscle sensitivity to digoxin and hence
patients are more prone to digoxin toxicity. Patients who are taking digoxin
and may be predisposed to hypokalaemia should have their serum potassium
levels monitored and potassium supplementation may be required. Digoxin

toxicity is manifested by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal
pain, visual disturbances, headache, confusion, drowsiness, arrhythmias and

Questions 7–26
A7 A
Fentanyl is a phenylpiperidine derivative and it is a potent opioid analgesic,
which is a pure agonist of μ-opioid receptors. Self-adhesive patches releasing
fentanyl are used for chronic intractable pain. The transdermal drug delivery
system releases the drug for about 72 h. Fentanyl may be given by intra-
muscular or intravenous injection as an adjunct to anaesthesia.
A8 A
Warfarin is an anticoagulant that acts by reducing the vitamin-K-dependent
synthesis of coagulation factors in the liver. Any activity that changes vitamin
K concentrations in the body may result in unexpected ﬂuctuations in dose
response in patients receiving warfarin. An increase in vitamin K levels through
direct vitamin K intake or through an increased intake of salads and vegetables
reverses the effect of warfarin. A decrease in consumption leads to a higher
anticoagulant effect for the same dose of warfarin as the levels of vitamin K,
which oppose its activity, are reduced. Alcohol has a variable effect on
warfarin therapy and major changes in consumption may lead to changes in
therapeutic outcome.
A9 A
Clozapine is a dibenzodiazepine which is used as an atypical antipsychotic.
It has activity as a dopamine-receptor blocker, an antiserotonergic, an anti-
muscarinic, an alpha-adrenergic blocker, and an antihistamine. It is indicated
in schizophrenia. A major disadvantage is that it may precipitate agranulo-
cytosis.

Ciclosporin is a calcineurin inhibitor that is used as an immunosuppressant in
organ and tissue transplantation. It has a very speciﬁc action on T-lymphocytes
and little effect on the bone marrow. It inhibits the activation of calcineurin,
which is required for the production of lymphokines, including interleukin-2.
When treatment is started, kidney function should be monitored for the ﬁrst
few weeks as a dose-dependent increase in serum creatinine and urea may
occur.
A11 D
Candesartan is an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist. When candesartan is
started in older persons, monitoring of plasma potassium concentration is
recommended as hyperkalaemia may occur occasionally. Older people may
be more prone to develop this side-effect because of reduced renal function.
A12 C
Prostate cancer is a slowly progressive adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland.
It is detected by prostate-speciﬁc antigen test and digital rectal examination.
The prostate-speciﬁc antigen test evaluates the amount of protein produced by
the prostate. The concentration of the protein is elevated in patients with cancer
or other prostate disease states. Prostate cancer is largely hormone-related
and is associated with androgen-dependent growth. Treatment is aimed at
androgen depletion and includes use of anti-androgens such as cyproterone
and gonadorelin analogues such as goserelin.
A13 D
Ondansetron is a 5-HT
3 antagonist which acts as an anti-emetic by blocking
serotonergic receptors in the gastrointestinal tract and in the central nervous
system. It is used to counteract cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced nausea and

vomiting, and in the postoperative nausea and vomiting that can be caused
by anaesthetics and opioid analgesics. In the management of chemotherapy-
induced nausea and vomiting, ondansetron is used in patients who are
receiving highly emetogenic drugs or when other anti-emetics were inadequate
for the prevention of acute symptoms. It may be administered in combination
with dexamethasone to improve symptom control. Metoclopramide and
prochlorperazine are more effective than the 5-HT
3 antagonists in the preven-
tion of delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Ondansetron is
not effective for the prophylaxis of motion sickness. In motion sickness the
vestibular apparatus in the ear stimulates the vomiting centre in the medulla
of the brain, resulting in nausea, pallor, sweating and increased salivation.
5-HT
3 antagonists have minimal effects on the vomiting centre. Hyoscine and
centrally acting antihistamines such as cinnarizine and dimenhydrinate are
used in the prevention of motion sickness.
A14 E
Cytotoxic drugs cause damage to normal cells, particularly where normal cell
division is fairly rapid, including hair follicles, resulting in alopecia and bone-
marrow suppression. For cytotoxic drugs that are irritant or vesicant, local irri-
tation and inﬂammation at the administration site may lead to extravasation.
Ulceration and necrosis may develop and further dose administration should
be undertaken at other sites. When bone-marrow suppression occurs this may
result in leucopenia. Its occurrence is a dose-limiting factor as further drug
administration has to be delayed until the leucocyte count is normalised.
Leucopenia increases the risk of infection. Patients should be advised to report
any signs of infection, such as fever, immediately. Colony-stimulating factors
such as ﬁlgrastim, pegﬁlgrastim and lenograstim may be used to reduce the
duration of neutropenia in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.
A15 B
In spirometry, the patient is asked to inhale and then to exhale as rapidly as
possible into a spirometer, which records the volume of air exiting the lungs.
Test 3: Answers 147


===== PAGE 177 =====
Forced vital capacity is measured as it is the amount of air that can be moved
during maximal inhalation and exhalation. The residual volume is the volume
of air that remains in the lungs after maximal expiration and this value together
with the forced vital capacity gives the total lung capacity.
A16 A
Methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains are resistant to a
number of antibacterial drugs. They may be sensitive to vancomycin or
teicoplanin. MRSA infections usually occur as a hospital-acquired infection
(nosocomial infection). Patients with identiﬁed MRSA infections are isolated
and carers are asked to undertake special precautions to restrain the spread
of infections. Using alcohol hand scrubs after handling patients decreases the
spread of infection. As management of the condition requires isolation of the
cases and use of expensive medications, MRSA infections in an institution
represent an economic burden.
A17 D
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is an enzyme that is found mainly in the liver
with lower amounts also present in the kidneys, heart and skeletal muscle. Its
quantiﬁcation in blood is used to identify hepatocellular diseases of the liver.
In liver injury or conditions such as viral hepatitis, ALT levels are increased as
it is released into the bloodstream.
A18 E
Aldosterone is a mineralcorticoid hormone which is produced by the adrenal
cortex with action in the renal tubule resulting in sodium and water retention
and potassium secretion in urine. Production of aldosterone is regulated
primarily by the renin–angiotensin system and to a lesser extent by adreno-
corticotrophic hormone, sodium and potassium levels. Low serum sodium levels
and high potassium levels stimulate aldosterone production.

Occurrence of protein in urine (proteinuria) is an indicator of renal disease,
as normally protein is not present in urine because it cannot pass through the
glomerular membrane in the renal tubules. When the glomerular membrane
is damaged, protein such as albumin seeps through the enlarged gaps in the
membrane. Urinalysis to identify presence of proteinuria is carried out to detect
renal disease and to detect pre-eclampsia in pregnant women. If urinalysis
indicates that there is signiﬁcant proteinuria, a 24-h urine specimen is collected
to quantify the protein loss in 24 h.
A20 B
Type I diabetes usually occurs in young people and is characterised by an
inability of the beta-cells in the pancreas to produce insulin. Disease manage-
ment requires insulin replacement using insulin. Patients should be encouraged
to undertake self-monitoring of blood glucose so as to avoid changes in blood
glucose levels leading to hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia. Patients should
be advised to lead a normal lifestyle and should be educated on how to
recognise the onset of hypoglycaemia. When symptoms of hypoglycaemia
such as sweating, tachycardia and hunger occur, the patient is advised to take
immediate action by consuming fast sugars such as glucose itself or sweets.
Sports and exercise reduces insulin requirements and decreases cardio-
vascular risk. A lower dose of insulin may be required before and after sports
activities.
A21 D
Aspirin is an antiplatelet drug that decreases platelet aggregation, whereas
warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that antagonises the effects of vitamin K.
Disadvantages of aspirin when it is used for its antiplatelet effects are that it
may cause bronchospasm and haemorrhage including gastrointestinal.
Occurrence of haemorrhage is much higher with warfarin and for this reason,
patients receiving warfarin should have their prothrombin time monitored.

Gallstones consist of cholesterol or bile and are usually asymptomatic. During
an acute attack patients usually present with biliary colic that is represented
with severe, episodic visceral pain in the abdomen. Pain may be precipitated
by a large meal. In patients where the gallstones consist mainly of cholesterol,
pain is precipitated with meals that have a high-fat content. Presence of gall-
stones is conﬁrmed by ultrasound.
A23 C
Sleep apnoea is characterised during sleep by periods of cessation of
breathing ranging from 10 seconds to 3 minutes. It results in loud snoring and
gasping. It occurs commonly in obese patients and in patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients with sleep apnoea may complain of
daytime sleepiness caused by their fragmented sleep at night. Weight loss in
obese patients is recommended as a non-pharmacotherapeutic management
strategy.
A24 B
Cannabis is in many countries an illegal drug and may not have approval for
medicinal use. It has analgesic, muscle relaxant and appetite stimulant effects.
It reduces intraocular pressure and has anti-emetic properties. Nabilone is a
synthetic cannabinoid that is used for its anti-emetic properties in the manage-
ment of cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting that are
unresponsive to other anti-emetic modalities.
A25 D
Corticosteroids have mineralcorticoid effects that result in sodium and water
retention, which leads to hypertension. Phenothiazines, which are used as
antipsychotic drugs, have antimuscarinic and alpha-adrenergic blocking

===== PAGE 180 =====
effects. They cause antimuscarinic side-effects such as dry mouth, constipation
and difﬁculty with micturition. They may cause hypotension especially in older
people. Alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drugs are used in hypertension and in
benign prostatic hyperplasia. They block the alpha-adrenoceptor in the sympa-
thetic nervous system causing vasodilation. Side-effects include hypotension,
dizziness, vertigo, headache, fatigue, oedema and sleep disturbances.
A26 B
Iron tablets may cause gastrointestinal irritation and patient may complain of
nausea and epigastric pain. The occurrence of these side-effects is reduced
by advising the patient to take the preparation with food, even though this
strategy lowers the absorption of iron. Side-effects may lead to the patient not
taking the medication. Administration of iron salts may lead to discoloration
of stools.
Questions 27–43
SN is an asthmatic patient who is using, by inhalation, salbutamol, a short-
acting beta2 agonist and beclometasone, a corticosteroid. Asthma is a respi-
ratory condition that is characterised by episodes of dyspnoea and wheezing
caused by bronchial constriction, coughing and viscous bronchial secretions.
Acute asthma attacks when severe may be fatal. On admission, salbutamol is
administered by nebuliser and SN is given oxygen. She is started on hydro-
cortisone intravenously as an anti-inﬂammatory drug, cefuroxime (second-
generation cephalosporin) intravenously and clarithromycin orally (macrolide)
as the antibacterials. Beclometasone inhaler therapy is continued.
A27 A
An asthmatic attack may be precipitated by various factors such as allergens
(e.g. pollen), foods (for example, tartrazine colorant) and environmental
factors (such as cold air, dust and cigarette smoke). Exposure to these factors
Test 3: Answers 151


===== PAGE 181 =====
may lead to bronchospasm which is followed by the development of increased
airways resistance and inﬂammation.
A28 A
In an acute attack there is an increase of eosinophils in the bronchial epi-
thelium releasing proteins and neurotoxins which damage the epithelium. In
addition inﬂammatory cells such as mast cells and basophils release spasmo-
gens such as histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, thromboxane and
platelet-activating factor. These result in bronchospasm and oedema, inﬂam-
mation and airway hyperactivitiy.
A29 A
Drugs that induce bronchospasm may provoke an asthmatic attack in patients
with asthma. SN should be advised to avoid using non-steroidal anti-inﬂam-
matory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac as they may provoke an asthma
attack. NSAIDs inhibit cyclo-oxygenase resulting in an increased amount of
arachidonic acid that is available. A higher arachidonic acid concentration
leads to an increased leukotriene production. Beta-adrenoceptor blockers such
as atenolol and timolol may also precipitate an asthmatic attack as they block
the sympathetic nervous system and hence induce bronchospasm in the
bronchial smooth muscle.
A30 A
On examination SN had rapid heart rate (tachycardia). During an acute attack
patients suffer from dyspnoea and with increasing severity of the attack they
become anxious, which also increases their heart rate. SN also presented
tachypnoea with a respiration rate exceeding 20 breaths/minute. This is
caused by hyperventilation, which results in patients feeling unable to speak
and complete sentences. SN also presented with exhaustion. Severe asthma
attacks interfere with patients’ sleep because of the distress caused, particu-
larly when the patient is lying down in bed.

The aims of treatment for SN are to promote recovery and to prevent further
deterioration. Up to 60% oxygen may be used and in fact SN was adminis-
tered 60% oxygen. In an acute, severe asthma attack, the arterial carbon
dioxide is usually decreased. During the severe attack, use of nebuliser
solutions of salbutamol may only aggravate hypoxia. SN is receiving oxygen
in conjunction with nebulised salbutamol as salbutamol may increase arterial
hypoxaemia.
A32 C
As soon as SN is hospitalised, peak expiratory ﬂow rate, blood gases and
serum electrolytes should be measured. These parameters should be continu-
ously monitored to assess improvement in the condition. Blood gases are
required to assess hypoxia (P
aO2 <8 kPa) and to evaluate arterial carbon
dioxide. During hypoxia, the risk of hypokalaemia is increased and this risk
is increased with the administration of salbutamol, which increases cellular
potassium uptake.
A33 B
SN has been administered hydrocortisone by intravenous injection which,
together with the oxygen and the nebulised salbutamol, is aimed to improve
respiration and pulse within 30 minutes. If this is not achieved, ipratropium by
nebulisation may be considered. Ipratropium is an antimuscarinic broncho-
dilator that when administered by nebulisation is very speciﬁc for lung tissue
and presents minimal side-effects. Use of nebulised solutions of ipratropium
are associated with the occurrence of acute angle closure glaucoma caused
by ipratropium aerosol coming in contact with the eye. The risk is further
increased if it is administered with nebulised salbutamol. Nebulised ipratro-
pium should be avoided in patients with glaucoma and care should be taken
to avoid escape of ipratropium aerosol. This can be minimised by using a
tightly ﬁtting mask. Intravenous aminophylline is another option as SN has not
been administered theophylline. Aminophylline has a different mode of action

===== PAGE 183 =====
to salbutamol and ipratropium. As aminophylline is associated with more
adverse effects including a higher risk of hypokalaemia, its use should be
restricted to attacks where improvement is not achieved with the other lines of
treatment. Aminophylline is administered as a slow intravenous bolus dose
because it causes venous irritation and rapid bolus doses may precipitate
cardiac arrhythmias, profound hypotension and hypokalaemia.
A34 B
Cefuroxime is a second-generation cephalosporin that is active against Gram-
positive cocci and against beta-lactamase-producing strains of 
Haemophilus

===== PAGE 184 =====
of glucocorticoids results in suppression of cortisol secretion from the adrenal
cortex and prolonged, high-dose therapy may lead to atrophy of the adrenal
cortex. As cortisol secretion is greatest in the morning, the dose should be
administered in the morning to minimise disturbance in circadian cortisol
secretion. Prednisolone dose should be continued until SN is stabilised. Peak
expiratory ﬂow rate should be monitored and care should be taken not to
precipitate the condition with early withdrawal of oral prednisolone.
Depending on the duration of the oral prednisolone therapy, gradual with-
drawal may be required to avoid withdrawal symptoms caused by adreno-
cortical insufﬁciency.
A38 B
Oral prednisolone may cause dyspepsia and oesophageal and peptic ulcer-
ation. Occurrence of these side-effects is reduced by administering the drug
after food and by using an enteric-coated formulation.
A39 B
Nebulisers are medical devices that are used to convert a solution to an
aerosol. They can deliver higher doses compared with a metered-dose inhaler.
They are preferred in patients who have difﬁculty in using a metered-dose
inhaler, and when higher doses are required such as in an acute attack. Nebu-
lisers should be washed out after each use or at least daily to avoid microbial
growth and consequent infection. Solutions that are prepared for use in nebu-
lisers should be used. Salbutamol is available as solution for nebulisation.
A40 E
Beclometasone is a corticosteroid that is being administered to SN as a
metered-dose inhaler. Beclometasone and budesonide are equally effective in
the management of asthma and they are used as prophylactic therapy to
reduce airway inﬂammation. A common side-effect of inhaled corticosteroids
is the development of oral candidiasis. This occurs due to deposits of the drug

Salmeterol is a long-acting beta 2 agonist with a duration of action of about
12 h. Onset of action occurs within 10 to 20 minutes of administration by
inhalation but the maximum effect is not achieved until regular administration
of successive doses. It cannot replace salbutamol in the relief of an acute
asthma attack. It is recommended to be used in combination with an inhaled
corticosteroid as life-threatening asthma attacks have been reported following
the use of salmeterol without an inhaled corticosteroid.
A43 B
SN should be advised to monitor for signs that indicate an exacerbation of
her condition. She should be advised to report any decrease in exercise
tolerance, increased requirements for salbutamol inhaler, and any decrease

lessness and tachycardia. In the long-term the goal is to improve exercise
capacity and limit risk of onset of a myocardial infarction (heart attack). In
ischaemic heart disease, as the number of coronary arteries with athero-
sclerosis and the extent of occlusion increase, the risk of angina and myo-
cardial infarction increases. Long-term management should consider reducing
atherosclerotic lesions with coronary angioplasty.

During the management of an acute attack of angina, pharmacotherapy is
used to reduce oxygen demand and to improve oxygen supply. In GL iso-
sorbide dinitrate is used. By causing dilation of the coronary veins isosorbide
dinitrate reduces venous return and results in a reduction of cardiac output.
Oxygen supply may be improved by using antithrombotic therapy and
antiplatelet therapy. When patients with ischaemic heart disease feel chest
pain they are usually advised to use sublingual glyceryl trinitrate or glyceryl
trinitrate spray and to take aspirin preferably dispersed in water or chewed
for a more immediate drug release compared with swallowing a tablet. A
single-dose of aspirin of 150–300 mg should be given as soon as possible
after the attack. Patient or carers should inform health professionals what medi-
cation the patient has already taken when symptoms of attack started. Heparin
is used to decrease platelet aggregation.
A48 C
Isosorbide dinitrate is a coronary vasodilator and side-effects of peripheral
vasodilation may occur. These include ﬂushing, throbbing headache, hypo-
tension and dizziness.
A49 A
When heparin is administered by intravenous or subcutaneous injection, it has
a rapid onset of action and an average halﬂife of 1.5 h. There is variability
in halﬂife ranging between 1 to 6 h depending on a number of factors such
as renal impairment and liver disease. It carries a risk of bleeding and the
patient should be monitored for signs of haemorrhage.
A50 D
Isosorbide dinitrate is initially given intravenously to achieve a fast onset of
action and response. Once GL is stabilised, and no chest pain is reported,
158 Test 3: Answers


===== PAGE 188 =====
isosorbide dinitrate is switched to oral administration. This usually requires
24–48 h. Heparin is given to reduce thrombin generation and ﬁbrin formation
and unless there are further complications, treatment is continued for about
48 h. Aspirin is used to reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction and GL
should continue taking aspirin daily as he was doing before the acute attack.
A51 A
Enalapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that has anti-
hypertensive effects. It is an appropriate choice of antihypertensive in GL as
ACE inhibitors are preferred drugs in diabetic patients. It is very important that
diabetic patients have their blood pressure very well controlled as these
patients have multiple risk factors towards the development of cardiovascular
disease. Also both long-standing uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes
increase the risk of kidney damage. GL had a myocardial infarction two years
earlier. ACE inhibitors have a cardioprotective effect in patients at high risk of
cardiovascular disease, including those who suffered a myocardial infarction.
A52 A
Metformin is a biguanide which, unlike sulphonylureas, is not associated with
weight gain. It is therefore an appropriate antidiabetic for GL who is obese.
It increases insulin sensitivity and increases the utilisation of glucose. It does
not interfere with insulin release. It may cause lactic acidosis. During treatment
metformin causes conversion of glucose to lactate in the intestinal mucosa;
lactate is transported to the liver where it is normally metabolised. High plasma
concentrations of metformin such as in renal impairment or high lactate
concentrations in blood caused by liver disease and alcohol abuse lead to the
inability by the liver to clear the lactate. Metformin should not be used in renal
impairment, and diabetic patients receiving metformin should have their renal
function monitored to exclude renal function deterioration, which may warrant
withdrawal of metformin.
Test 3: Answers 159


===== PAGE 189 =====
A53 A
Metformin increases the use of glucose and increases insulin sensitivity. It is
not associated with onset of hypoglycaemia and it does not cause weight gain.
To decrease gastrointestinal side-effects such as abdominal discomfort,
nausea, diarrhoea and metallic taste, patients are advised to take tablets with
meals. Gastrointestinal side-effects are quite common and in some patients
lead to the patient not accepting treatment with metformin.
A54 B
ACE inhibitors such as enalapril interfere with the conversion of angiotensin I
to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and stimulates aldosterone
release. As ACE inhibitors prevent the formation of aldosterone, they reduce
potassium excretion and may lead to hyperkalaemia. Heparin may also induce
hyperkalaemia because it inhibits aldosterone secretion from the adrenal
glands. Risk of hyperkalaemia is increased in diabetic patients, in patients
with chronic renal failure and in patients taking potassium-sparing diuretics.
Furosemide is a loop diuretic that inhibits sodium, potassium and water
retention in the kidney and its use may precipitate hypokalaemia.
A55 D
Simvastatin is a statin that is used as a lipid-lowering agent. Use of statins is
recommended in patients with ischaemic heart disease to decrease morbidity
and mortality. They are used to reduce low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and
slow atherosclerosis. Patient should be advised to follow a diet low in choles-
terol in conjunction with long-term statin therapy. Before initiating statins, liver
function tests should be carried out, as statins are contraindicated in active
liver disease. There is no interaction between statins and non-steroidal anti-
inﬂammatory drugs.

Glyceryl trinitrate patches should be applied on chest wall, upper arm or
shoulder and replaced daily. For each application, the patch should be placed
on a different area. The patch should be removed at night to provide a nitrate-
free period. This will reduce development of tolerance to glyceryl trinitrate.
A57 D
GL may be prescribed glyceryl trinitrate spray which can be used for the
prophylaxis of angina when onset of symptoms occur. The patient is advised
to apply one or two doses under the tongue and close mouth. If there is no
response within 10 minutes, the same dose may be repeated. The advantage
of the spray over the sublingual tablets is that sublingual tablets have problems
of stability which require the patient to discard any tablets remaining after
8 weeks from opening.
Questions 58–62
On admission, MG is taking nifedipine, a calcium-channel blocker and aspirin
as an antiplatelet agent. He is admitted with a stroke, a cerebrovascular
accident that is occlusion of a cerebral artery by an embolus in the brain or
cerebrovascular haemorrhage. The condition leads to ischaemia of the brain
tissues. The location and extent of ischaemia have an impact on the sequelae
of the attack. Paralysis, speech impairment or death may occur. In MG, hyper-
tension is a major predisposing factor for stroke. Other factors that increase
risk of stroke include age, diabetes, transient ischaemic attacks and previous
stroke. MG is admitted to hospital to be given support and medical manage-
ment of the acute phase of the stroke. The use of antiplatelet agents in the
management of a non-haemorrhagic stroke is the main line of treatment aimed
at preventing formation of thrombi in the arterial vessels. Aspirin is indicated
to be used immediately after a non-haemorrhagic cerebrovascular event.
Aspirin has antiplatelet effects as it irreversibly inhibits cyclo-oxygenase, which
in platelets is responsible for the conversion of arachidonic acid into

thromboxane A2 which is a vasoconstrictor and stimulates platelet aggrega-
tion. Dipyridamole may be used in combination with low-dose aspirin to
reduce the risk of recurrent stroke.
A58 B
Dipyridamole is an adenosine reuptake inhibitor and a phosphodiesterase
inhibitor which has antiplatelet and vasodilating properties. It is given in oral
doses of 300–600 mg daily in divided doses. It is incompletely absorbed from
the gastrointestinal tract and therefore it should be administered before food.
Dipyridamole should be used with caution in patients with hypotension, heart
failure, rapidly worsening angina, aortic stenosis and myocardial infarction.
It is essential to avoid hypotension, to maintain systemic circulation and to
avoid orthostatic changes in patients with an acute stroke, as compromised
blood supply to the brain may precipitate degeneration of the condition.
A59 A
The most common side-effects to be expected from dipyridamole are gastro-
intestinal effects such as nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, dizziness,
throbbing headache, hypotension, hot ﬂushes and tachycardia. Risk of occur-
rence of constipation is higher in hospitalised patients and in patients with
limited mobility.
A60 E
Nifedipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker. It has predominant
activity as a peripheral and coronary arteries vasodilator. As it has minimal
effect on cardiac conduction and negative inotropic effect is very low at thera-
peutic doses, it rarely precipitates heart failure. It is used in the management
of hypertension and for the prophylaxis of angina.
162 Test 3: Answers


===== PAGE 192 =====
A61 B
Nifedipine is rapidly and efﬁciently absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract
but undergoes an extensive ﬁrst-pass effect. Following oral administration of
normal release tablets, it has a halﬂife of about 2 h. Use of normal-release
tablets in the management of hypertension leads to large variations in blood
pressure as a three-times-daily dosage regimen would still leave periods during
which blood pressure is not controlled. Also, occurrence of reﬂex tachycardia
is higher. Modiﬁed-release preparations are preferred and in fact MG was
receiving modiﬁed-release tablets of 20 mg three times daily. Bioavailability
of slow release formulations is lower than conventional tablets.
A62 A
Blood pressure should be monitored in MG. Hypertension should be controlled
and development of hypotension avoided. Heart rate and signs and symptoms
of heart failure such as oedema should be monitored.
Questions 63–65
GX is receiving glibenclamide (sulphonylurea), isosorbide mononitrate
(nitrate), aspirin (antiplatelet), perindopril (angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor), calcium supplement and cod liver oil capsules. From this medication
review it can be understood that GX is receiving treatment for the manage-
ment of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. All the medications except for
glibenclamide are prescribed as a single daily dose. For isosorbide mono-
nitrate 60 mg slow-release tablet is prescribed.
A63 A
Glibenclamide is a second-generation sulphonylurea that has a duration of
effect of 20–29 h but which may be even longer in older people. Its use in
GX should be undertaken with care as the risk of hypoglycaemic attacks is
Test 3: Answers 163


===== PAGE 193 =====
higher than other sulphonylureas such as gliclazide and glipizide. Hypo-
glycaemia may lead to confusion, unconsciousness and coma if no immediate
intake of glucose is taken. This is of concern for GX who lives on her own.
According to this medication proﬁle, GX is taking quite a high dose of gliben-
clamide. The usual recommended dose of glibenclamide is 5 mg at breakfast
to a maximum of 15 mg daily. The dose of glibenclamide and suitability of
the drug for GX should be discussed with the prescribing team.
A64 E
An advantage of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as
perindopril is that they do not interfere with glucose tolerance and they can
be used as antihypertensive agents or for the management of heart failure in
diabetic patients. A maximum daily dose of 8 mg of perindopril may be recom-
mended. Deterioration in renal function, which can be monitored by
measuring blood urea and creatinine concentrations, may occur, especially in
patients who have existing kidney disease and heart failure. Monitoring
parameters to be measured in GX should include renal function.
A65 D
Isosorbide mononitrate is an active metabolite of isosorbide dinitrate. Advan-
tages over isosorbide dinitrate include a higher bioavailability after oral
administration as it does not undergo ﬁrst-pass hepatic metabolism and a

and in congestive heart failure.

methotrexate and prednisolone, as an anti-inﬂammatory agent. She is also
receiving folic acid, calcium and vitamin D supplements and disodium
pamidronate, which is a biphosphonate. In rheumatoid arthritis, aims of
treatment are to decrease disease progression, limit morbidity and decrease
occurrence of ﬂare-ups.
A66 E
Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with inﬂammation of the synovial membrane
of different joints. It is not a localised condition and affects different joints
commonly in the hands, wrists, knees, feet and shoulders. Trigger factors are
not clear but there is evidence that the condition is immune-mediated.
A67 A
There is great inter-patient variation in the course of the disease. Onset is
insidious and the disease usually presents initially with non-speciﬁc symptoms
such as fatigue, malaise, diffuse musculoskeletal pain and stiffness. Charac-
teristically, at onset the patient presents with symmetrical small-joint polyarthri-
tis in the hands, wrists and feet. Diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis
include presence of morning stiffness, presence of arthritis in three or more
joints, symmetrical involvement, rheumatoid nodules, serum rheumatoid factor
and radiographic changes.
A68 A
As rheumatoid arthritis progresses, morning stiffness becomes prolonged and
more disabling, interfering with patient’s daily activities. When assessing
outcomes of therapy, functional assessment and impact on the patient’s lifestyle
should be considered. Factors to be taken into account include duration of
morning stiffness, the patient’s ability to dress and carry out daily activities,
and grip strength.

As rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inﬂammatory disease, patients may
develop anaemia. This occurs because of reduced erythropoiesis during
inﬂammatory disease. The use of prednisolone for long periods may cause
peptic ulceration with perforation leading to gastrointestinal bleeding, which
may be another cause for anaemia. Methotrexate may also cause intestinal
ulceration and bleeding. Development of signs and symptoms of gastric irri-
tation and ulceration should be monitored and AV should be asked to report
any gastrointestinal effects. Measurement of creatine kinase (CK) is indicated
in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, neurological or skeletal muscle
disease.
A70 A
In AV methotrexate is prescribed as a weekly dose of 15 mg. It is very
important to advise AV about proper administration of the drug and the
pharmacist should ensure that the patient has understood the dosage regimen.
Fatalities may occur if patients inadvertently take the drug at this dose daily.
Methotrexate is considered to be a ﬁrst-line drug in the management of
rheumatoid arthritis and the usual maximum dose is 15 mg once a week. AV
is given folic acid to reduce nausea and stomatitis, which may be side-effects
of methotrexate. It is also given as a once weekly dose, and to aid compli-
ance the patient is advised to take folic acid the day after methotrexate
administration. Methotrexate may cause bone marrow suppression and
therefore patients are more prone to develop infections. AV should be advised
to report immediately any signs of an infection such as sore throat or fever.
Methotrexate may also cause pulmonary toxicity, and patients should be asked
to report cough and dyspnoea. Bone marrow suppression may be further
increased by long-term administration of prednisolone, a glucocorticoid. As
both methotrexate and prednisolone may cause gastrointestinal ulceration, AV
should be advised to take tablets after food.

As methotrexate may cause bone marrow suppression, the patient should have
a full blood count, including differential white cell count, regularly. If signiﬁ-
cant leucopenia or thrombocytopenia occurs, treatment should be stopped as
the condition may be fatal. Renal function should also be monitored, as the
use of methotrexate in moderate or severe renal impairment is not recom-
mended. Methotrexate may cause liver cirrhosis, and liver function tests should
be carried out regularly. AV should be advised to avoid alcohol to lower her
risk of hepatic damage.
A72 A
Disodium pamidronate is a biphosphonate that may be used in the prophyl-
axis and treatment of osteoporosis and corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis.
AV is receiving prednisolone as a long-term medication to suppress symptoms
of the disease. Discontinuation of treatment may lead to ﬂare-ups of the
condition. Long-term use of corticosteroids is associated with onset of osteo-
porosis, diabetes and hypertension. AV is a post-menopausal woman who is
at a higher risk of developing osteoporosis, compared with the normal female
cohort group, as she is also receiving prednisolone long-term therapy. In AV
disodium pamidronate is used to counteract corticosteroid-induced osteo-
porosis. A disadvantage of disodium pamidronate is that it is only available
for slow intravenous infusion, which is given every 3 months, requiring the
patient to be hospitalised for about 3 h. Its use may lead to hypocalcaemia
and serum electrolytes should be monitored. Other biphosphonates such as
alendronic acid and risedronate, which are available as once weekly oral
formulations, may be considered as an alternative. AV is receiving calcium
and vitamin D supplementation to prevent hypocalcaemia and as bone
supplements in the management of osteoporosis.

destruction in rheumatoid arthritis. Both drugs are available for parenteral
administration. They are recommended for use in rheumatoid arthritis when
other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs have failed to achieve symptom
control. As they have been associated with the onset of severe infections,
including tuberculosis, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis before
treatment and asked to report any signs of infection.

MA suffered an acute attack of shingles, which is caused by the virus herpes
zoster. The condition is associated with a unilateral rash and the patient
complains of pain which may continue after the rash has disappeared, leading
to postherpetic neuralgia.
A74 A
Shingles occurs as a result of reactivation of the varicella zoster virus that is
dormant in the nuclear DNA of dorsal root ganglia. Reactivation of the virus
may occur as a result of a reduction of the host immunity. The virus tracks
down the nerve axon to cause a skin infection in the area innervated by the
sensory nerve and this is characterised by vesicular eruptions.
A75 D
Shingles usually occurs along the thorax, head and neck and lumbosacral
area. Eye or ear involvement may occur and this requires referral of the patient
to a specialist to limit long-term damage. Postherpetic neuralgia may develop
as a chronic painful condition that may last from months to years after the
acute phase of shingles. Postherpetic neuralgia presents with severe, con-
tinuous, burning pain.

Famciclovir is a prodrug of penciclovir. Famciclovir is rapidly absorbed from
the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration and it is converted to
penciclovir. Penciclovir itself is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
Famciclovir has better bioavailability (70%) compared with aciclovir (30%)
after oral administration. For this reason famciclovir and valaciclovir, which is
a prodrug of aciclovir, require less frequent dosing compared with aciclovir
in the management of shingles. MA was receiving famciclovir 250 mg tablets
three times daily during the acute phase.
A77 B
Use of antiviral drugs such as famciclovir at the onset of the acute phase
reduces the risk of postherpetic neuralgia. Famciclovir should be continued for

Side-effects associated with famciclovir are rare and these include nausea,
headache, confusion, vomiting, jaundice, dizziness, drowsiness, halluci-
nations, rash and pruritus.

Questions 1–3
Medical devices are used for the diagnosis and monitoring of diseases.
Accuracy and reliability of the device may vary and reﬂect on the product’s
costs. Speciﬁcations for medical devices may depend on their intended use.
A1 A
An ophthalmoscope is used to examine the fundus of the eye, which consists
of the retina, retinal vessels, sclera, optic disk and choroids. It can be used to
diagnose and assess the progression of retinopathy where retinal changes
occur. Retinopathy could be brought about by hypertension or diabetes.
A2 C
A stethoscope may be used for auscultation of heart sounds or breath sounds.
Abnormal breath sounds such as wheezes and bronchial breath sounds may
occur with airways obstruction or respiratory tract infections.
A3 E
A reﬂex hammer is used to evaluate deep tendon reﬂexes. It is used to assess
damage to the spinal reﬂex arc such as after a cerebrovascular accident.
Questions 4–6
An understanding of the control of hormones and mechanisms that affect their
production and release is essential to understand the pathology of the disease
states that are related to the endocrine system.

A4 E
Human chorionic gonadotrophin is a hormone that is secreted by trophoblastic
cells in the placenta and is excreted in the urine of pregnant women. It
stimulates the corpus luteum to secrete oestrogen and progesterone and to
decrease lymphocyte activation. Its presence in urine is used as the indicator
for pregnancy in pregnancy tests.
A5 B
C peptide is an inactive residue of insulin formation in the beta cells of the
pancreas. It is degraded in the kidney. Measurement of serum C peptide may
be used in diabetic patients who are being treated with insulin and who have
anti-insulin antibodies. Diminished kidney function may lead to increased
amounts of C peptide in serum.
A6 D
Prolactin is a hormone that is produced by the anterior pituitary gland. In
conjunction with other hormones such as oestrogen and progesterone, it
stimulates development of mammary glands. After parturition, it stimulates and
maintains breast milk production. Prolactin blood levels are used in the
diagnosis of prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas.
Questions 7–26
A7 A
Creatine kinase (CK) is an enzyme that is found in heart muscle, skeletal muscle
and the brain. There are three isoenzymes: CK-BB (CPK1) which is pre-
dominantly found in the brain and lungs, CK-MB (CPK2) mainly found in myo-
cardial cells and CK-MM (CPK3) which consists of circulatory CK. Creatine
kinase blood levels rise when these muscle or nerve cells are injured.
194 Test 4: Answers


===== PAGE 224 =====
Differential elevations of the three isoenzymes indicate the type of tissue that
has been damaged. A rise in CK-BB occurs after a cerebrovascular accident
or pulmonary infarction. CK-MB is elevated after a myocardial infarction and
in unstable angina. However, severe skeletal muscle injury may also elevate
CK-MB. CK-MM levels are increased in myopathies, after vigorous exercise or
surgery.
A8 D
Auscultation of bowel sounds is undertaken to identify bowel obstruction or
ileus. Ileus is a condition where there is an obstruction of the intestines resulting
from immobility or mechanical obstruction. Ileus may be due to opioid drugs
and could occur postoperatively because of the administration of opioid drugs
and anaesthesia. After a surgical intervention, bowel sounds are monitored
using a stethoscope to eliminate ileus. Normal bowel sounds indicate peristal-
sis and may be audible without the use of a stethoscope.
A9 B
A complete blood count (CBC) is a series of tests on a blood sample to present
red blood cell count, haemoglobin level, haematocrit, red blood cell indices
(mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, mean corpuscu-
lar concentration), white blood cell count and differential count for different
components, blood smear and platelet count.
A10 B
The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a non-speciﬁc test that indicates
conditions of inﬂammation, infection, malignancy and tissue necrosis or infarc-
tion. The test is a measure of the rate at which red blood cells settle out of
mixed venous blood over a speciﬁed period. The test requires that a blood
sample is aspirated into a calibrated sedimentation tube and blood is allowed
to settle usually for 60 minutes. ESR together with other indicators may be used
to evaluate disease progression.

Gastro-oesophageal reﬂux disease (GORD) is usually due to reﬂux oesophagi-
tis, which results in acid regurgitation. Stomach contents which have a low pH
are reﬂuxed into the oesophagus and the oesophageal mucosa has very little,
if any, protection against acidic contents. Dysphagia, which is difﬁculty in
swallowing, may sometimes occur in GORD. Stricture formation of the oeso-
phagus may take place in GORD, owing to the inﬂammation caused by acid
regurgitation.
A12 C
A mixture of magnesium hydroxide and aluminium salts in antacid prepara-
tions is referred to as co-magaldrox. Antacid preparations are used for the
symptomatic management of dyspepsia, gastro-oesophageal reflux and
gastric pain. Patients are advised to use the preparation after meals and at
bedtime when required. Co-magaldrox preparations have the advantage that
they eliminate the side-effects of magnesium salts (diarrhoea) and aluminium
salts (constipation) as they cancel each other out. Patients should be advised
not to take antacid preparations at the same time as other medications as
antacids may impair absorption of the other drugs. Antacids may damage
enteric-coated tablets, resulting in the dissolution of the drug in the stomach,
thus defeating the purpose of using an enteric-coated formulation.
A13 E
Some drugs may cause phototoxic or photoallergic reactions if the patient is
exposed to ultraviolet light. When patients taking amiodarone (for arrhyth-
mias) are exposed to direct sunlight or to sun lamps, photosensitivity may occur
owing to a phototoxic reaction. A skin reaction may occur and this may
continue for some weeks after treatment when amiodarone is stopped. Patients
using amiodarone should be advised to use total sunblock preparations, to
wear protective clothing and to avoid exposure to sun.

Immunoglobulins are used in clinical practice to induce passive immunity and
therefore to present immediate protection against an infectious disease.
Human immunoglobulins may be of two types: normal immunoglobulin or
specific immunoglobulins. Normal immunoglobulin presents antibodies
against several infectious diseases, whereas speciﬁc immunoglobulins present
a speciﬁc antibody such as hepatitis B immunoglobulin. Human immuno-
globulins are prepared from pooled plasma or serum of human donors. The
human donor material is tested for presence of hepatitis B surface antigen and
for antibodies against hepatitis C virus and human immunodeﬁciency virus.
Human immunoglobulins are preferred to antisera (immunoglobulins) as they
are associated with a lower incidence of hypersensitivity reactions.
A15 B
Glue ear, also referred to as sero-mucinous otitis media, is a condition where
there is an accumulation of viscous mucous ﬂuid in the middle ear, usually
occurring after repeated attacks of acute otitis media. It occurs most commonly
in children. Glue ear may also be found in association with inﬂammation of
the sinuses and blockage of the eustachian tube. Deafness or difﬁculty in
hearing is usually the presenting symptom and in some cases this may go
unnoticed and lead to permanent hearing loss.
A16 B
Hepatitis C is a viral infection that is transmitted through contact with contam-
inated blood such as when sharing needles and through intravenous drug
misuse or the transfusion of infected blood. In hepatitis C, the aim of treatment
is to achieve the clearance of the virus, which is sustained for at least 6 months
after treatment has stopped. This reduces the risk of cirrhosis and hepato-
cellular carcinoma. Patients may require a liver transplant to prevent death
caused by cirrhosis. Interferon alfa is used in combination with ribavirin
(antiviral drug). Peginterferon alfa consists of a polyethylene glycol-conjugated

derivative of interferon alfa. Pegylation results in increasing the availability of
interferon in blood and therefore halﬂife is extended so that the dosing
frequency that is required is reduced.
A17 A
A stroke, also referred to as a cerebrovascular accident, is due to acute neuro-
logical dysfunction of vascular origin in focal areas of the brain. It may present
as a completed stroke, where the signs and symptoms occur for more than
24 h, or a transient ischaemic attack if the signs disappear within a few
minutes or at most within 24 h. Patients with transient ischaemic attacks or
stroke are at an increased risk of further stroke, myocardial infarction or
sudden death. Pharmacotherapy that could be used to prevent these sequalae
include long-term prophylaxis with daily aspirin. An angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitor should be considered, especially in patients with
hypertension, to reduce blood pressure and for the prophylaxis of cardio-
vascular events. Hypercholesterolaemia is a risk factor for atherosclerosis
and cardiovascular disease. Statins may be considered to decrease plasma-
cholesterol concentrations.
A18 B
Colorectal cancers may be classiﬁed according to the Duke’s classiﬁcation,
which was originally described in 1932, or according to the TNM classiﬁ-
cation. A stage III or a Duke’s C tumour implies that tumour cells have invaded
the musculature and that there is lymph node involvement. There is a 10–40%
chance of a 5-year survival rate. Patients with stage III colorectal cancer should
receive adjuvant chemotherapy to decrease the high risk of recurrence. Choice
of adjuvant chemotherapy is based on a risk-to-beneﬁt ratio for the individual
patient who is usually asymptomatic after tumour resection. Side-effects and
the method of administration should be taken into account when deciding
which drugs to use. Drugs that do not require an invasive administration, such
as drugs presented in oral formulations – for example, capecitabine – are
preferred to drugs that require lengthy intravenous infusions such as irinotecan.

Calcium supplementation increases net calcium absorption and decreases
bone turnover. Many adults are in negative calcium balance throughout their
lives, an imbalance that worsens with age and increases the risk of osteo-
porosis and bone fracture. Calcium supplementation presents calcium salts as
tablets, chewable tablets or effervescent tablets. The patient is required to take
a sustained daily intake of the calcium supplement for a prolonged time. Poor
compliance is quite common with individuals stopping intake or taking the
supplementation intermittently. Products containing calcium and vitamin D may
be used in the management of osteoporosis to prevent fractures. Cacitriol, a
metabolite of vitamin D, enhances the absorption of calcium from the small
intestine. Different calcium salts may be used for supplementation such as
calcium lactate, calcium carbonate and calcium gluconate. Calcium carbonate
has the highest calcium content per gram of salt.
A20 C
Myopia is an ophthalmic condition resulting in parallel rays being focused in
front of the retina. It may be caused by an elongation of the eyeball or by an
error of refraction. The condition is also called nearsightedness or shortsighted-
ness as affected individuals cannot clearly see objects that are more than a
metre from the eye. Concave lenses for spectacles or contact lenses are used
to correct the error.

Patients following a low-fat diet should be advised to increase ﬁbre intake
which is found in fruits, green leafy vegetables, root vegetables, cereals and
breads. This will increase satiety and may interfere with fat absorption due to
adsorption with fat molecules. Saturated fat is found mainly in food of animal
origin such as beef, pork, lamb and whole-milk products. A diet high in
saturated fats results in high serum cholesterol levels and high serum low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Polyunsaturated fat is predominantly

following a low-fat diet should restrict their intake of saturated fats and concen-
trate more on polyunsaturated fat.

Atopic eczema is a skin condition characterised by pruritus and inﬂammation.
A prominent feature is dry skin. Atopic eczema may become infected because
of the patient scratching the area, which is intensely pruritic. The skin is more
susceptible to microbial colonisation because of dehydration and inﬂamma-
tion. Patients should be advised to avoid scratching the area and to use
emollients and emollient bath oils instead of regular soap and bubble baths
when bathing. These can be used and applied as needed.
A23 D
Phenytoin is an antiepileptic drug that has a narrow therapeutic drug index.
Monitoring of plasma concentrations is used to reduce phenytoin toxicity by
assessing that the plasma concentration is within the therapeutic range. It is
particularly useful when patient is started on the treatment, during dose adjust-
ments to achieve seizure control or when the patient complains of side-effects
that may be attributed to high plasma concentrations of phenytoin. In cancer
chemotherapy, side-effects, particularly neutropenia and other speciﬁc side-
effects such as cardiac toxicity for doxorubicin, are the dose-limiting
parameters that are used. Alteplase is a ﬁbrinolytic drug that is used as quickly
as possible in myocardial infarction, stroke and pulmonary embolism.
Alteplase is a glycosylated protein and it is cleared rapidly from plasma mainly
by metabolism in the liver.

Kidney transplantation is necessary when there is irreversible failure of the
kidney. There are a number of complications associated with this intervention,
including donor identification, organ preservation and organ rejection.
Immunosuppressive agents are used to promote acceptance of the donor
organ, while maintaining as much as possible a functional immune system.
Azathioprine, prednisolone, which is a corticosteroid, and ciclosporin are
used in kidney transplantation to prevent organ rejection.
A26 B
Anaemia in cancer patients may be chemotherapy-induced or may be due to
the tumour. The tumour may result in bone marrow inﬁltration or lead to gastro-
intestinal blood loss. The process of development of anaemia in cancer
patients may not be clearly understood. Anaemia develops insidiously. It may
be corrected with the use of human recombinant erythropoietin, particularly if
it is chemotherapy-induced. Erythropoietin and darbepoetin, which is the
hyperglycosylated derivative of erythropoietin, are used to correct anaemia.
Questions 27–34
On admission, LJ is taking bendroﬂumethiazide (thiazide diuretic), warfarin
(anticoagulant) and potassium chloride supplements to counteract potassium
loss brought about by the thiazide diuretic. She has a past history of hyper-
tension and asthma and she is admitted with atrial ﬁbrillation. Atrial ﬁbrilla-
tions are cardiac arrhythmias characterised by disorganised electrical activity
in the atria. Clinical symptoms include shortness of breath, irregular pulse,
dizziness, acute syncopal episodes and heart failure symptoms. Treatment

===== PAGE 231 =====
goals are restoration of sinus rhythm and prevention of further recurrences.
On admission she is started on digoxin (cardiac glycoside) and perindopril
(angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor).
A27 B
Atrial ﬁbrillation is a supraventricular arrhythmia that may be precipitated
by cardiovascular disease that causes atrial distension, such as hypertension,
ischaemia and infarction. It represents a chaotic, disorganised atrial activa-
tion. Ventricular premature beats constitute a form of ventricular arrhythmias.
A28 B
An electrocardiogram may be undertaken for LJ to conﬁrm the nature of the
arrhythmias, and 24-h recordings may be preferred to allow monitoring. Drugs
such as amitriptyline (tricyclic antidepressant) and lithium (antimanic drug) may
interfere with the QT interval which represents the time between depolarisa-
tion and repolarisation of the ventricles. Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors
such as ﬂuoxetine are not associated with prolonged QT intervals.
A29 B
Occurrence of atrial ﬁbrillation increases the risk of stroke and heart failure.
A30 B
In atrial ﬁbrillation, the ventricular response results in a rapid ventricular rate.
Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that may be used in the management of atrial
ﬁbrillation to control ventricular response. Beta-blockers are used to control the
ventricular rate. They should be avoided in LJ as she has a past history of
asthma. Beta-blockers should be used with caution in asthma as they may
cause bronchospasms. Digoxin increases the force of myocardial contraction
202 Test 4: Answers


===== PAGE 232 =====
and decreases conductivity in the atrioventricular node. It does not interfere
with blood pressure.
A31 A
Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic range but plasma concentration is not the
only factor indicating risk of toxicity. There is inter-individual variability in the
sensitivity of the conducting system or the myocardium to digoxin. Lower doses
should be started in elderly patients and the drug should be used with care
as a decreased renal elimination may result in toxic effects. Digoxin should
also be used with care in renal impairment and in patients who recently have
had an infarction. In renal impairment, the electrolyte disturbances associated
with renal disease such as hypokalaemia predispose to toxicity. Caution
should be employed with its use following a myocardial infarction because of
increased sensitivity of the myocardium.
A32 A
When LJ is hospitalised, serum potassium levels should be checked and
monitored to avoid occurrence of hypokalaemia. In LJ hypokalaemia may
precipitate further arrhythmias, and increases the risk of digoxin toxicity.
Plasma digoxin concentration is useful to ensure that the dose results in a
plasma concentration that is within the therapeutic range and therefore the risk
of toxicity is minimised. The ventricular rate at rest should be monitored to
assess outcomes of therapy and to assess ventricular response to atrial ﬁbril-
lation.
A33 D
LJ is started on perindopril because she has uncontrolled blood pressure.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are preferred to beta-blockers
in patients with asthma. For the management of hypertension, the recom-
mended initial dose is 4 mg daily. LJ was started on a lower dose because
Test 4: Answers 203


===== PAGE 233 =====
she is an elderly patient and she is receiving bendroﬂumethiazide, which is a
diuretic. LJ is more at risk of developing ﬁrst-dose hypotension. The dose is
given at night to limit injuries associated with hypotension.
A34 D
ACE inhibitors such as perindopril cause potassium retention because they
inhibit secretion of aldosterone. They should not be used concurrently with
potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics as there is a risk of the
development of hyperkalaemia, which should be avoided particularly in LJ as
it poses a risk of cardiac rhythm disturbances, namely ventricular ﬁbrillation
and cardiac asystole. Perindopril should be continued for the management of
hypertension. Sustained hypertension in LJ may have precipitated atrial ﬁbril-
lation and may precipitate other cardiovascular conditions. Warfarin therapy
should be continued as patients with chronic atrial ﬁbrillation are at risk of
developing embolism that may lead to stroke and death. In LJ the use of aspirin
is not indicated as it may precipitate an asthmatic attack.
Questions 35–43
AX presents with symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis ﬂare-up. On admission, AX
is receiving methotrexate as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, ﬂuva-
statin (statin), folic acid and paracetamol as required. Clinical laboratory
investigations are normal except for a slight depression in the red blood cell
count. Further investigations are required before a cause of anaemia can be
established. The red blood cell count may be repeated and haemoglobin levels
measured. AX has a previous history of peptic ulceration and colonic polyps
in addition to rheumatoid arthritis. AX is administered methylprednisolone for
one day.
A35 D
Rheumatoid arthritis is a progressive disease that is associated with deterio-
ration in patient mobility and a reduction in life expectancy of 7 years in males
204 Test 4: Answers


===== PAGE 234 =====
and 3 years in women. The aims of treatment in rheumatoid arthritis are to
relieve pain, inﬂammation and symptoms of ﬂare-ups, to prevent joint destruc-
tion and to preserve functional ability so that the patient can lead as normal
a lifestyle as possible.
A36 A
Monitoring of outcomes of therapy and of disease progression includes
biochemical tests where changes in inﬂammatory markers are followed.
Biochemical tests that are undertaken include the measurement of C-reactive
protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor and
antinuclear antibodies. These markers are not speciﬁc to rheumatoid disease
and so changes in levels may be experienced when patient has an inﬂamma-
tory condition.
A37 B
In AX, methylprednisolone is administered by slow intravenous infusion as a
single dose to control symptoms associated with the ﬂare-up and to induce
remission. It has glucocorticoid effects resulting in an anti-inﬂammatory action
due to suppression of cytokines. Administration, especially parenteral, results
in a rapid improvement in symptoms. It is used only to reduce symptoms of
ﬂare-up and should not be continued orally in the long term.
A38 D
Corticosteroids are associated with the development of peptic ulceration. Use
of corticosteroids in AX should be undertaken with caution and considered
only to treat aggressive ﬂare-ups or until the condition is managed with
different disease-modifying antirheumatic agents. There are no interactions
reported when methylprednisolone is used in patients receiving ﬂuvastatin and
no correlation with allergy to leﬂunomide.
Test 4: Answers 205


===== PAGE 235 =====
A39 B
Methylprednisolone is a steroid with a greater glucocorticoid activity
compared with prednisolone and lower mineralcorticoid effects. About 4 mg
of methylprednisolone are equivalent to the anti-inﬂammatory activity experi-
enced with 5 mg prednisolone. Methylprednisolone is similar to other corti-
costeroids and is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when
administered orally.
A40 E
In addition to anti-inﬂammatory and immunosuppressive effects, glucocorticoid
activity results in metabolic effects including a decrease in peripheral glucose
utilisation and an increase in gluconeogenesis. This may lead to hyper-
glycaemia and increased insulin requirements in diabetic patients. When
measuring blood glucose, consideration has to be given to whether the
measurement was undertaken post-prandially or when the patient was fasting.
A41 B
Cytokine inhibitors such as inﬂiximab, etanercept, adalimumab are used as
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in the management of rheumatoid
arthritis. They may be considered to be additional treatment with methotrexate
if the frequency of ﬂare-ups increases in AX.
A42 A
Methotrexate is commonly prescribed as a weekly dose. Dispensing errors and
errors in drug administration, where the patient takes the drug on a daily basis
may occur. Patient should be counselled to ensure understanding of the dosage
regimen. Nausea and vomiting may occur with drug administration. Bone
marrow suppression is another side-effect of methotrexate. Patients should be

advised to report any signs of infection and a full blood count should be
performed every few months.
A43 E
AX is prescribed folic acid to be taken weekly to prevent the stomatitis that
may occur as a result of methotrexate therapy. Folic acid is used to counter-
act the folate-antagonist action of methotrexate. Folic acid is reduced in the
body to tetrahydrofolate.
Questions 44–47
MB is complaining of palpitations, where the patient is aware of his or her’s
heart beat, and this may present as a distressing phenomenon. Palpitations
may be signs of arrhythmias and tachycardia.
A44 B
Moxonidine is a centrally acting drug that blocks imidazoline and alpha
2-
adrenoceptors. It is used for the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension,
especially where the condition is unresponsive to ﬁrst-line therapy.
A45 D
Methyldopa and clonidine are two other antihypertensive drugs that are
centrally acting. Moxonidine is a newer drug that is associated with fewer
side-effects owing to its central action. Doxazosin blocks the alpha-adrenocep-
tors in the blood vessel walls and therefore brings about vasodilation. In hyper-
tension doxazosin and other alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drugs are used in
conjunction with other antihypertensives. Alpha-adrenoceptor blockers are
used as single therapy in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Hydralazine is a vasodilator that is used as an adjunct to other antihyper-
tensives in the management of moderate-to-severe hypertension.
A46 E
Moxonidine is structurally similar to clonidine. As for clonidine, abrupt with-
drawal should be avoided as it may be associated with an increased cathecol-
amine release that may be manifested with agitation, sweating, tachycardia,
headache, nausea and rebound hypertension. MB may be presenting with
symptoms of palpitations caused by this effect as there are no other indica-
tions of symptoms related to heart failure and stroke. Bradycardia, severe
arrhythmias, severe heart failure, severe ischaemic heart disease and severe
renal or hepatic impairment should be excluded before moxonidine therapy
is started again.
A47 C
Long-standing hypertension may cause complications associated with cardio-
vascular dysfunction, such as myocardial infarction, stroke and peripheral
vascular disease in the retina, kidneys and extremities. Hypertensive patients
should undergo tests to assess the presence or extent of end organ damage.
Tests include retinal examination, electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, kidney
function tests.
Questions 48–52
RB has systemic sclerosis, which is a type of scleroderma where there is chronic
hardening and thickening of the skin caused by collagen formation. Raynaud’s
phenomenon is often a concomitant condition. Raynaud’s phenomenon is
characterised by intermittent attacks of ischaemia in the extremities of the body
especially ﬁngers and toes. On admission RB was taking pentoxifylline
(vasodilator) and nifedipine (calcium-channel blocker).
208 Test 4: Answers


===== PAGE 238 =====
A48 E
During an attack of Raynaud’s disease, ﬁnger discoloration is common. Pain
is not usually a prominent symptom. RB is presenting with swelling, tenderness
and mild erythema. There is also a clear discharge beneath the nail fold which
may indicate infection. The management plan should include use of an anti-
bacterial agent to treat the infection that may have precipitated the symptoms.
Co-amoxiclav given as an intravenous therapy is an appropriate ﬁrst choice
anti-bacterial agent as it is a broad spectrum agent. Co-amoxiclav consists of
clavulanic acid potentiated amoxicillin.
A49 B
Pentoxifylline is a xanthine derivative that has vasodilating properties. It
increases blood ﬂow to ischaemic tissues and results in an improvement of
tissue oxygenation in the affected areas. Side-effects of pentoxifylline include
gastrointestinal disturbances, dizziness, agitation, sleep disturbances and
headache. Hypotension may also occur and pentoxifylline should be used with
caution in patients with hypotension. Pentoxifylline may be used as long-term
therapy in the management of Raynaud’s disease to reduce severe symptoms
and the frequency of acute attacks.
A50 B
Factors that reduce blood ﬂow in the ﬁngers increase the risk of an acute
attack. RB should be advised to avoid exposure to cold temperatures and to
use lined gloves when handling food in freezers. She should use gloves in
winter to protect them from the cold. She should be advised to stop smoking
and information on smoking cessation should be provided. Emotional stress
and anxiety may also precipitate an attack.

A51 D
Atenolol is a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug. These drugs result in a reduced
peripheral circulation leading to coldness of extremities and may exacerbate
an acute attack of Raynaud’s disease.
A52 E
Nifedipine is a calcium-channel blocker which, unlike verapamil, has more
inﬂuence on the peripheral and coronary vessels than on the myocardium.
Nifedipine is a vasodilator that reduces the frequency and severity of
vasospastic effects in Raynaud’s phenomenon. Its effect is better when started
early during the disease process. The use of a modiﬁed-release formulation
reduces variations in blood pressure and decreases reﬂex tachycardia. Patient
should be advised to swallow the tablet whole.
Questions 53–59
FG is admitted with symptoms of pulmonary oedema, chest infection and
angina. Her clinical laboratory tests, indicate hypokalaemia and leucocytosis.
She also has a high creatine kinase value which, together with the ST
depression and T wave ﬂattening, indicate recent ischaemia. Cardiomegaly
is brought about by congestive heart failure. FG’s blood glucose level is
extremely high. On admission FG’s drug therapy consisted of paroxetine
(selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor), potassium chloride supplement,
verapamil (calcium-channel blocker), dipyridamole (antiplatelet), bumetanide
(loop diuretic) and multivitamins.
A53 A
On admission aims of treatment for FG are to control blood glucose levels, to
treat infection, to reduce pulmonary oedema and to provide prophylaxis
against ischaemic events. After an infarct, diabetic patients present with a high

===== PAGE 240 =====
blood glucose level as a result of a stress response by the body. Insulin is
required to reduce high blood glucose and patient should be maintained on
insulin therapy until stabilised. An assessment whether patient should continue
to receive antidiabetic treatment is required. High glucose levels, together with
the other disease states, increase FG’s risk of ischaemic attacks which may be
associated with morbidity and mortality. Nitrates such as isosorbide dinitrate
are administered parenterally to prevent ischaemic attacks and to relieve
patient from the ischaemic pain. Nitrates are vasodilators. They bring about
an improvement in collateral blood ﬂow in the heart and promote reperfusion,
thus limiting infarct size and preserve functional tissue. The use of aspirin after
an ischaemic event is associated with a lower risk of secondary thrombotic
cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease.
A54 A
FG has presented with hypokalaemia, which is corrected by increasing the
dose of potassium chloride supplements. Serum potassium levels should be
monitored. One of the complications of myocardial infarction is heart failure
and this is particularly relevant for FG, who already has a history of heart
failure. FG is presenting with symptoms of heart failure, and bumetanide
therapy may be switched to intravenous therapy for a few days until the
oedema is controlled. Verapamil is a calcium-channel blocker which slows
conduction in the atrioventricular node. Verapamil may cause worsening of
heart failure so it is recommended to stop verapamil therapy during this phase.
A55 B
Oxygen therapy is started in the emergency department so as to provide
support to FG, who presents with shortness of breath. Oxygen is administered
with masks delivering 35% oxygen. As it is being administered intermittently
there is no need to use a nasal cannula; this is preferred when the patient is
going to require long-term administration of oxygen. Administering oxygen by
a nasal cannula decreases the interference caused by oxygen administration
on eating, drinking and talking because the mouth is not obstructed. An

Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). SSRIs together with
tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are used in the management of depression.
SSRIs and TCAs have similar efﬁcacy but they differ in the side-effect proﬁle.
The preference to use SSRIs is based on fewer antimuscarinic and cardiotoxic
side-effects. SSRIs may cause gastrointestinal effects, and side-effects include
movement disorders and dyskinesias. Paroxetine is a phenylpiperidine
derivative. Fluoxetine is another SSRI with similar properties to paroxetine.
Fluoxetine has a different chemical structure as it is a phenylpropylamine
derivative.
A57 B
Dipyridamole is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and an adenosine reuptake
inhibitor. It has antiplatelet and vasodilating properties. It is used for secondary
prevention of ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attacks. Its use in FG
should be monitored as dipyridamole should be used with caution in rapidly
worsening angina. Reports of transient myocardial ischaemia in patients with
unstable angina have been documented. Side-effects associated with the use
of dipyridamole include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dizziness, myalgia,
throbbing headache, hypotension, hot ﬂushes and tachycardia. Bleeding
disorders are not a common side-effect. Increased bleeding may occur during
or after surgery.
A58 A
A chest radiograph reveals cardiomegaly in FG. Cardiomegaly or enlarge-
ment of the heart, usually caused by left ventricular hypertrophy, occurs to
accommodate the increased ventricular load. In heart failure, the ability of

===== PAGE 242 =====
cardiac muscle to respond to an increased preload through increased elastic
recoil is diminished. Sustained increased preload leads to loss of elastic recoil
possibilities. The increased ventricular load associated with cardiomegaly may
lead to pulmonary congestion. An increase in oxygen requirements of cardiac
cells leads to development of tachycardia, arrhythmias and myocardial
ischaemia.
A59 B
Bumetanide may result in water and electrolyte imbalance, which may be
manifested by hypotension, muscle cramps, headache, dry mouth, thirst and
weakness. Dipyridamole may also cause hypotension. If the patient is started
on a nitrate, it also may cause hypotension. Blood pressure should be
monitored in FG, particularly during changes in drug therapy.
Questions 60–66
AP has a history of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. She presents with
chest pain and symptoms of unwellness. As she reports that pain started at
rest and is occurring from time to time, AP probably has unstable angina.
Stable angina is not associated with chest pain at rest. The ECG shows T wave
inversion, indicating recent infarction and this is conﬁrmed from the elevated
creatine kinase level. On admission AP is taking candesartan (angiotensin-II
receptor antagonist), clopidrogel (antiplatelet), isosorbide mononitrate
(nitrate), ﬂuvastatin (statin), amlodipine (calcium-channel blocker), carvedilol
(beta-adrenoceptor blocker), bumetanide (loop diuretic), and isophane insulin
(intermediate-acting insulin).
A60 B
Carvedilol is a non-cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker. It blocks the
beta-receptors of the sympathetic nervous system in the heart, peripheral vascu-
lature, bronchi, pancreas and liver. A characteristic of carvedilol is that it also

===== PAGE 243 =====
has vasodilating properties and it is used in the management of heart failure,
where it has been shown to decrease mortality. Unlike atenolol, carvedilol has
high lipid solubility.
A61 B
Hypotension may occur as a common side-effect of a number of drugs that
are included in AP’s treatment. Isosorbide mononitrate is a vasodilator that
presents postural hypotension as a common side-effect. Carvedilol, which also
has vasodilating properties, may also cause postural hypotension. Amlodip-
ine and candesartan too may cause hypotension, and the risk is higher in
patients who are taking diuretics and may develop dehydration. Amlodipine
commonly induces ﬂushing especially at the start of therapy and isosorbide
mononitrate may also cause ﬂushing.
A62 E
Candesartan is an ester prodrug and it is hydrolysed to the active form during
absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. It is an angiotensin-II receptor
antagonist that blocks the angiotensin receptors, resulting in a decreased effect
of angiotensin II. Angiotensin-II receptor antagonists have similar properties to
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Both classes of drugs are used
in the management of hypertension and heart failure. An important feature of
angiotensin-II receptor antagonists is that, unlike ACE inhibitors, they do not
inhibit the breakdown of bradykinin. This activity, which occurs with ACE
inhibitors, is associated with cough as a side-effect of ACE inhibitors. Cough
does not usually occur with candesartan and other angiotensin-II receptor
antagonists and in fact they may be used in patients who are intolerant to ACE
inhibitors owing to this side-effect. It has a long elimination halﬂife (about 9 h)
and is usually given as a once-daily dose. Angiotensin-II receptor antagonists
should be used with caution in renal artery stenosis as they may reduce
glomerular ﬁltration rate precipitating renal failure.

Isophane insulin is an intermediate-acting insulin preparation that allows twice-
daily injection. AP should be advised to avoid episodes of hypoglycaemia by
correctly following the dose administration of insulin and keeping a standard
food intake pattern. The risk of hypoglycaemia is highest before meals and
at night. A response to hypoglycaemia is the activation of the sympathetic
nervous system and adrenal medulla. This response leads to tremor, pallor,
sweating, shivering, palpitations and anxiety, which are early clinical signs of
hypoglycaemia. Such a response increases oxygen demand in the cardiac
muscle and may precipitate angina attacks and myocardial infarction in AP.
During an anginal attack, glycaemic control is lost because of the resulting
metabolic stress and insulin requirements are increased.
A64 D
Isosorbide mononitrate is a nitrate that is used in angina. Nitrates are potent
coronary vasodilators and bring about a reduced venous return. It has an
elimination halﬂife of 4–5 h. Modiﬁed-release formulations are available
where dosage regimen is once daily. The advantages of a modiﬁed-release
formulation is that major peaks and troughs in drug blood levels are avoided
and this results in better control of anginal symptoms. Once-daily dosing of
the modiﬁed-release formulation results in low blood-nitrate concentrations
towards the end of the 24-h period, and this avoids the development of the
tolerance associated with nitrates. Isosorbide mononitrate is metabolised to
inactive metabolites such as isosorbide and isosorbide glucuronide.
A65 B
Fluvastatin is a statin that acts as a 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A
(HMG CoA) reductase inhibitor. Statins are used as lipid regulating drugs and
they reduce low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL cholesterol). AP should be
advised to report muscle pain immediately as statins may cause myalgia and
muscle weakness, which may be associated with myopathy, which may

===== PAGE 245 =====
progress to rhabdomyolysis and renal failure. Occurrence of myopathy and
rhabdomyolysis is associated with an elevated creatine kinase. Statins should
be used with caution in patients with a history of liver disease and are not
indicated during active liver disease. Liver function tests are required before
starting statin therapy. Statins should be used with caution in severe renal
impairment. Renal function tests should be carried out at baseline. AP was
taking ﬂuvastatin 80 mg at night, which is the maximum recommended dose.
Hypothyroidism should be corrected before starting statins as correction may
resolve the hyperlipidaemia. Thyroid function tests should be carried out,
especially in elderly patients who may have a hypothyroid state with sub-
clinical symptoms. Simvastatin is another statin that may be used as an alterna-
tive and the maximum therapeutic dose is 80 mg daily.
A66 A
Unstable angina may present with negative outcomes and requires immediate
hospitalisation. Complete bed rest is recommended for a few days. AP should
be started on oxygen, isosorbide mononitrate is changed to a nitrate intra-
venous infusion, such as isosorbide dinitrate injections. AP is already on
clopidrogel which is an expensive antiplatelet drug. Clopidrogel is used in the
management of unstable angina. Heparin or the low-molecular-weight
(LMWH) heparins may be used for the ﬁrst 2–5 days. Use of heparin products
with clopidrogel increases risk of bleeding.
Questions 67–70
KB presents with symptoms associated with disorders of the urinary tract. She
is complaining of dysuria (painful urination) that occurs as a result of infection
or obstruction in the urinary tract. KB also presents with urinary urgency and
urinary frequency.
216 Test 4: Answers


===== PAGE 246 =====
A67 B
The symptoms presented by KB are suggestive of a lower urinary tract infection
also known as cystitis, where the bladder and urethra are involved. Bacteria
may ascend the urinary tract to affect the kidneys leading to acute pyelonephri-
tis. A common causative organism of cystitis and acute pyelonephritis is
Escherichia coli. Vulvovaginitis is an inﬂammation of the vulva and vagina,
which is not associated with urinary urgency and urinary frequency.
A68 B
Patient should be asked about occurrence of fever. This helps to differentiate
between cystitis and acute pyelonephritis. The latter is associated with fever,
chills, pain in the sides and nausea, in addition to the urinary symptoms.
Pharmacists can carry out a urinalysis to conﬁrm diagnosis. Bacterial urinary
tract infection leads to an alkaline urine pH as a number of organisms,
including 
E. coli, are urea-splitting organisms. Haematuria and the presence
of nitrites in urine caused by bacterial enzymes that reduce urinary nitrates to
nitrites also occur. The test may be repeated after the recommended treatment
has been completed so as to conﬁrm that bacterial infection has been eradi-
cated. Culturing of bacteria present in urine from mid-stream samples may be
required to identify causative organism, to use anti-bacterial agents that are
active against the particular microorganism. However, in the normal setting,
when the patient is presenting with primary symptoms and there are no other

KB is advised to drink lots of water to ﬂush out the urinary system and dilute
the microorganisms. Alkalinisation of urine may be used to relieve the discom-
fort caused by the urinary tract infection. Potassium citrate salts are used. If
KB has signs of acute pyelonephritis or symptoms have not subsided with
potassium citrate salts, then antibacterial agents are required.

Antibacterial agents that are active against E. coli are recommended for the
management of cystitis and acute pyelonephritis. Drugs used include broad-
spectrum penicillins such as amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav, broad-spectrum
cephalosporins such as cefalexin and cefuroxime, trimethoprim and quino-
lones such as ciproﬂoxacin.
Questions 71–75
SC is presenting with high blood pressure during the ﬁrst month of pregnancy.
Increased blood pressure during pregnancy may be associated with pre-
eclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation.
A71 B
As there is hypertension before the ﬁrst 20–24 weeks of pregnancy, there is
a probability that hypertension was pre-existing before conception. SC has a
higher risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia presents with hyper-
tension, proteinuria and oedema. Complications of pre-eclampsia include
early delivery, low-birth-weight and eclampsia, which can result in maternal
and fetal death. Eclampsia is associated with seizures and coma. Hyper-
tension may be due to secondary causes. However, this cannot be deduced
from the clinical presentation.
A72 A
During pregnancy, SC should be monitored to assess the development of the
symptoms of pre-eclampsia, namely hypertension, proteinuria and changes in
fetal growth. During check-ups SC should have her blood pressure measured
and urinalysis routinely carried out. Fetal growth should be regularly
monitored.

A73 A
During pregnancy, the use of thiazide diuretics, beta-adrenoceptor blockers,
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor
inhibitors should be avoided. Thiazide diuretics may cause neonatal thrombo-
cytopenia. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor inhibitors may affect
maternal renal function and lead to intrauterine death. Beta-blockers may
cause intrauterine growth retardation. They may be used after the third
trimester if other drugs are not effective or are contraindicated.
A74 E
Methyldopa, a centrally acting antihypertensive agent, may be used in
pregnancy. It has a very good safety record when used for the management
of hypertension in pregnancy. Hydralazine, a vasodilator, may be used after
the third trimester.
A75 B
Labetalol is a non-cardioselective drug that acts as a competitive antagonist
to alpha and beta-receptors in the sympathetic nervous system. Owing to its
action on the alpha receptors, it results in vasodilation leading to a lower
peripheral resistance. The chemical structure of labetalol has two optical
centres and formulations available clinically may present a mixture of the four
diasteriomers.
Questions 76–80
HG is presenting with symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Allergy results from an
inappropriate immune response by the body to an allergen. HG states that
she has been using oxymetazoline spray, which is a direct-acting sympatho-
mimetic agent that is used as a nasal decongestant.
Test 4: Answers 219


===== PAGE 249 =====
A76 B
HG may have the perennial type of allergic rhinitis as she states that she has
recurrent attacks of nasal allergy indicating that the attacks may not be
seasonal. Allergens include house dust, pollen and pet fur. Exposure to the
allergen(s) results in mast cells and T lymphocyte activation that lead to the
release of histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins and kinins. Symptoms of
allergic rhinitis include nasal itching, rhinorrhoea, itchy throat, sneezing and
dry cough, particularly at night. Conjunctival symptoms may also occur.
A77 B
In HG, oxymetazoline provides relief against nasal congestion. Oxymetazo-
line is an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist and its topical administration causes
nasal vasoconstriction, thus reducing swelling and congestion in the nasal
mucous membranes. However, prolonged use may lead to rebound conges-
tion, also known as rhinitis medicamentosa. Patients should be advised not to
use it for more than 1 week. HG should be advised to stop using oxymetazo-
line. Oxymetazoline is available for topical nasal application as nasal spray
or nasal drops.
A78 D
Desloratidine is an antihistamine that may be used for symptomatic relief in
HG. The product may be used on a long-term basis and the non-sedating
property of desloratidine is an advantage with regards to the lower incidence
of sedation compared with older sedating agents. Desloratidine is an active
metabolite of loratidine and it is available for oral administration on a once-
daily regimen. Antihistamines reduce secretions, nasal itching, sneezing and
ocular symptoms and are considered to be a ﬁrst-line option in the manage-
ment of mild or intermittent allergic rhinitis.

Budesonide is a corticosteroid that was developed for inhalation for the
management of asthma. It is also available as a nasal spray for use in allergic
rhinitis and as an oral formulation that is used in the management of Crohn’s
disease. Corticosteroids are used in the treatment and prophylaxis of allergic
rhinitis and asthma. Corticosteroids decrease production of cytokines and
chemokines associated with the inﬂammatory reaction brought about after
exposure to allergens.
A80 B
HG should be advised to avoid exposure to allergens. She should be advised
to avoid walking in gardens and to use products to eradicate house dust mites
regularly in the house. Blood in sputum (haemoptysis) is not associated with
allergies or asthma but may indicate conditions such as lung cancer or
infectious diseases, for example, tuberculosis. Its occurrence requires referral
for assessment.
